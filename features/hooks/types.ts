// agents-hooks/v1 — vendored subprocess-hook contract for tg-cli.
//
// This is the universal hook framework described in
// docs/specs (review-cli architecture-visual-verification.md §7) and
// /tmp/detector-cli/design.md. The whole point: a host tool (tg) can run an
// OUT-OF-PROCESS hook (e.g. a Python `review visual` gate) before an action,
// with the hook deciding allow/block over a tiny JSON-on-stdin / exit-code
// protocol. No shared runtime between host and hook.
//
// Design invariants baked into these types:
//   - Block is signalled by RESERVED EXIT CODE 10 (un-corruptible). stdout JSON
//     carries the human message and future fields. A hook that *intends* to
//     block but emits malformed JSON still blocks, because exit 10 is the
//     canonical signal — malformed-JSON can never silently bypass a gate.
//   - Fail-open by DEFAULT (on_error: 'open'): a hook crash / timeout / bad
//     output must NEVER break a daily `tg` send. A security gate may opt into
//     on_error: 'closed'.
//   - TRUST-BY-DEFAULT: a dropped descriptor LOADS AND RUNS by default — this is
//     the user's own machine, so the TOFU ceremony is needless. The legacy TOFU
//     quarantine + sha-pin re-engages ONLY under the opt-in, off-by-default guard
//     AGENTS_HOOKS_TRUST=1 (the rare paranoid / untrusted-input case). Under the
//     guard a freshly-dropped, not-yet-trusted descriptor is QUARANTINED-AS-ABSENT
//     (treated as if it does not exist) until pinned; AGENTS_HOOKS_TRUST=auto is
//     the batch/agent escape hatch that bypasses the pins inside the guard.
//   - SECURITY NOTE: a drop-in hook descriptor names an EXECUTABLE that `tg`
//     runs on EVERY photo send. Since they run with no trust step by default,
//     ONLY the user (or their own tools) should ever write to ~/.agents/hooks/tg/.
//   - Append-only audit.jsonl: in a fail-open system the only thing telling
//     "honestly allowed" from "silently bypassed" is the log line. Kept in BOTH
//     the trust-by-default and the guarded paths.

// ("closed"→"open") NOR an invocation swap can silently change what runs:
//   - cmd_sha256:        the executable's bytes (catches a swapped binary).
//   - invocation_sha256: a digest of cmd + args + timeout_ms (catches a

//     `args` at a different script, or drops `--strict`, OR lowers `timeout_ms`
//     so a fail-open gate is forced to time out and allow). Without this, a
//     trusted interpreter is a universal-execution primitive and a trusted gate
//     is defeatable by a one-field timeout edit that survives the pin.
