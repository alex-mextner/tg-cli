"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-send-photo hook -> `review visual`.

REFERENCE executable for the `review-visual` descriptor. In production this file
is owned by review-cli and installed under ~/.agents/skills/review/hooks/ by
`review install-hook tg`; it is vendored here so the tg-cli hook framework has a
runnable, testable counterpart for the contract.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  - stdin: a JSON event
      {tool:"tg", point:"pre-send-photo", args:{image_path, caption, chat_id}, ...}
  - stdout: protocol JSON only  -> {"hook_api":"agents-hooks/v1","decision":...,"message":...}
  - stderr: human logs
  - exit code is the CANONICAL block signal:
      exit 0  -> allow (decision:"allow")
      exit 10 -> BLOCK (decision:"block", message = the verdict reason)
      any other exit -> hook error (the host applies its on_error policy)

Verdict mapping (architecture spec §7.3):
  - review verdict keep                 -> allow, exit 0
  - review verdict rollback (unstyled / broken / blank)
                                        -> block, exit 10, message from reason
  - human_review / unverified / no API  -> allow + WARN (fail-open), exit 0
    (a missing API key or an indecisive vision call must never brick a send)

# --- empty-editor watermark heuristic (WARN-only, see main()) --------------
#
# VS Code renders a small, muted "watermark" dead center of the editor PART
# only when the active editor group has ZERO open tabs — a genuinely empty
# editor/preview pane. This is a much NARROWER signal than the removed
# looks_like_vscode_window() (HYP-891): that one matched ANY full window via
# a dark, uniform left activity-bar strip and false-positived on legitimate
# content-full screenshots at least twice in one day. A watermark only ever
# renders over a perfectly flat editor background with a compact glyph
# cluster — a real code file, canvas render, or webview fills the same
# region with dense, varied content and cannot produce this pattern,
# regardless of whether the surrounding Explorer/Inspector/Logs panels are
# busy (they usually are, per Alex's tg#6041 full-window proof standard, so
# the check is scoped to a central box rather than the whole image).
#
# CALIBRATION (tg#6651/tg#6672 follow-up — first REAL reference data this
# heuristic has ever had): every threshold below used to be reasoned from
# VS Code's assumed watermark layout (a short list of keybinding-hint TEXT
# rows), never verified against an actual empty-editor-group screenshot —
# and that assumption was wrong. Two real screenshots of a genuinely empty
# VS Code Dark Modern window (Explorer docked left, a Chat panel docked
# right, zero editor tabs — see tests/fixtures/vscode-empty-watermark-*.png)
# show the CURRENT VS Code watermark is a single big flat translucent LOGO
# mark, not hint-text rows, and `looks_like_empty_vscode_watermark()`
# returned False on BOTH real screenshots under the old constants. Direct
# pixel analysis of both (identical results on both, since they differ only
# in Explorer tree state, irrelevant to this box) found two compounding
# bugs, not one:
#
#   1. The OLD box (0.20-0.90 x) physically overlaps a docked right panel on
#      this common layout. That panel's own background is a DIFFERENT
#      near-black shade ((25,26,27) vs the editor's (18,19,20), diff ~7) —
#      itself invisible at the old tol=20 — but real panel foreground pixels
#      (text/icons) and the thin Explorer|Editor / Editor|panel divider
#      border lines (~(42,43,44), diff ~22-24, sitting right at the box's own
#      edges by construction) DID cross tol=20 and were the actual "non-bg"
#      signal detected — not the watermark. Because those artifacts sit at
#      the box's extreme edges, the measured span blew up to ~0.93 (x) /
#      ~0.80-0.86 (y), correctly rejected by WATERMARK_MAX_SPAN_RATIO but for
#      the WRONG reason (panel bleed, not "real content is spread out").
#   2. Once the box is narrowed clear of both docked panels, the real logo's
#      own fill color — (13,13,14) against the editor's (18,19,20) bg — is a
#      contrast of only ~6-7 RGB levels: still invisible at tol=20. At that
#      point _sample_box detects ZERO non-bg pixels at all (ratio 0), a
#      different false negative ("no signal") than bug #1's ("signal spans
#      too much").
#
# Fixing both (narrower box + lower tol) reproduces the SAME numbers on both
# real screenshots: non_bg_ratio ≈ 0.116, span_x ≈ 0.315, span_y ≈ 0.448 —
# the values the constants below are now calibrated against, with margin.
# Verified NOT to false-positive against 7 real BUSY full-window screenshots
# pulled from other HyperIDE e2e runs (code editor + Hyper Canvas preview +
# error/warning panes, some with a centered icon+table not unlike a
# watermark shape) — all still return False under the new constants, mostly
# rejected on span (0.55-0.9, comfortably over the new 0.35/0.50 caps).
#
# HONEST LIMITS (not solved by this pass): both real reference screenshots
# are the SAME window layout (Explorer + Chat panel, same widths) — one data
# point on panel geometry, not two. A materially different sidebar/panel
# width could still bleed into the box the same way bug #1 did; the box
# below is a measured-safe value for this one layout, not a proven-general
# one. Separately, the real logo's contrast (~7) sits only 2-3 RGB levels
# above the noise floor the "noisy near-flat background" synthetic test
# already exercises (±4) — WATERMARK_BG_TOL rides a narrow, real window
# between those two numbers, not a comfortable margin. Both are exactly why
# this stays WARN-only, not a block: an unvalidated pixel heuristic
# hard-blocking a legitimate send is the HYP-891 failure mode this file
# already exists to avoid repeating.
#
# BOX PLACEMENT (review finding, still true): the watermark centers on the
# EDITOR PART, not the WINDOW -- on a real full-window screenshot the editor
# part is offset right by the Activity Bar + Explorer sidebar (~15-20% of
# width). The box below stays asymmetric (biased right of window-center) for
# that reason, just narrower than before on both ends to also clear a
# docked right panel (see calibration note above).

# tol fix. 0.15 admits that with margin. Verified this does not re-admit
# genuinely busy content: 7 real full-window screenshots with dense code /
# preview / table content measure 0.045-0.49 here -- the ones under 0.15
# still get rejected by the span cap below, not this range.
#
# Lower bound (review finding): VS Code's real hint rows are THIN text/icon
# strokes, not a filled block. A synthetic icon block + 5 thin (3px) text
# rows -- deliberately sized so every stroke is guaranteed at least one
# sampled pixel regardless of the WATERMARK_SAMPLE_STEP=3 grid's phase --
# samples at ratio ~0.006 on the box+grid size above, just above the
# original 0.005 floor. Real hint text could plausibly render even thinner
# (sub-3px strokes / anti-aliasing) than that synthetic floor case, so this
# is lowered with a safety margin below it rather than exactly at the

    blown up to ~1.0 by a single stray non-bg pixel far from the hint-row
    cluster (a minimap sliver, a scrollbar edge, an AA fringe) that can land
    inside the sample box on a real full-window screenshot — which would make
    the detector MISS the very watermark it exists to catch (review finding).
    Trimming the outer `trim` fraction of coordinates at each end absorbs a
    few stray pixels while still rejecting genuinely spread-out content.

    `int(n * trim)` alone rounds to 0 for any n below ~1/trim -- with
    trim=0.05 that's every n <= 19, exactly the sparse-cluster sample counts
    the lowered density floor (WATERMARK_NONBG_RATIO_RANGE) now allows
    through (review finding: a real sparse watermark can land in that exact
    range). At those counts the trim was silently a no-op. Guarantee at
    least ONE point trimmed off each end once there are enough points for
    that to leave a non-empty core; below that, trimming would erase the
    signal entirely, so skip it. "Non-empty" specifically means a core of
    >= 2 points (n - 2*k >= 2), not merely >= 1 (review finding): a 1-point
    core collapses to span=0 regardless of the real spread -- e.g. 3 points
    at [0, 500, 1000] would trim to the single midpoint and read as
    perfectly compact. That's unreachable through the full detector
    pipeline today (the density floor guarantees far more samples than
    that), but this function is documented as a general-purpose, unit-
    tested-in-isolation utility, so its own contract must hold regardless.

    KNOWN LIMIT (review finding): trimming is per-axis and caps at ~`trim`
    fraction of the mass on each end, so it defends against a LONE outlier
    (a handful of stray pixels), not a genuine second cluster that happens
    to hold less than that fraction of the total -- an asymmetric bimodal
    split (e.g. 95% of the mass in one cluster, 5% in a second, far-away
    one) could still trim the minority cluster away and read as "compact".
    Same root cause at small n (review finding): for 4 <= n <= 19,
    `max(1, int(n*trim))` forces k=1 regardless of n, so exactly ONE stray
    point is absorbed per end -- TWO outliers on the SAME side at that n
    range aren't both trimmed, and the span can still blow up. Accepted for
    a WARN-only, unvalidated heuristic; a real fix needs actual clustering

    # activates for ANY tg-sent photo, in ANY language (tg#6188) — the caption was
    # already in the event args and simply ignored. --intent is documented as
    # UNTRUSTED, read-only free text on review's side: it can only TIGHTEN which
    # checks run / how strict the contract is, never loosen a verdict — this hook's
    # whole safety case rests on that being true, since it now hands the sender's own
    # text a channel into the gate. Verified directly against review-cli's source (not
    # just its docstring) as of alex-mextner/review-cli#110:
    #   - reviewlib/features/visual/contract.py::derive_contract / _intent_raises_risk
    #     only ever RAISES risk from intent, never lowers it (`if risk != "high"` guard).
    #   - reviewlib/features/visual/registry.py::ContributedModule.activates and
    #     reviewlib/features/visual/contrib/selection_highlight.py's own `activates`
    #     only ever ADD activation from intent (an OR of independent conditions) — there
    #     is no path where intent text can turn OFF a check.
    # No code path lets intent DEACTIVATE a check or LOWER risk, so forwarding arbitrary
    # caption text here is safe by that existing, source-verified contract.
    #
    # NOT runtime-enforced: `review_bin` resolves via PATH to WHATEVER review-cli is
    # installed, not pinned to the commit this was verified against — there is no
    # version check here. If a future review-cli release ever let intent loosen a
    # verdict, this hook would silently inherit that (the sender-controlled caption
    # would gain real leverage over the gate). Deliberately not adding version
    # enforcement for that here — out of proportion to this fix — but flagging it as an
    # assumption this hook depends on, not a runtime-checked guarantee.
    #
    # ACCEPTED TRADE-OFF: this now applies to EVERY tg photo, not just ones an actor
    # deliberately marked for verification. An ordinary caption that happens to mention
    # a visual concept unrelated to this specific render (e.g. "selected the file in the
    # sidebar") can now trigger an intent-gated CV veto that stayed silent before. That
    # is accepted for the same reason review-cli's own synonym trade-off is (tg#6188):
    # a spurious block is loud and recoverable (resend without that wording, or with
    # --check), a silently-passed false "selected" screenshot is not.
    #
    # Trimmed (not byte-for-byte "verbatim"): only leading/trailing whitespace is
    # stripped; NUL bytes are dropped too, since embedding one in a subprocess argv
    # raises ValueError at call time.
    #
    # CRITICAL: an unencodable caption must DROP --intent, not crash the subprocess
    # call. A NUL byte is not the only argv-breaking input — an unpaired UTF-16
    # surrogate (e.g. a lone "\ud800", which survives a JS JSON.stringify ->
    # Python json.loads round-trip intact) raises UnicodeEncodeError when
    # subprocess.run encodes argv, and that is ALSO a ValueError subclass. If that
    # were allowed to propagate into run_review_visual's `except (OSError, ValueError)`,
    # a sender crafts one caption and the ENTIRE `review visual` call — not just
    # --intent — never runs, resolving to allow(): a caption would then be able to
    # disable visual verification outright, exactly the "intent can loosen a
    # verdict" case the safety comment above says can't happen (review found this
    # as a real, security-relevant gap in an earlier draft of this fix — a bare NUL
    # strip did not cover it). So: pre-flight-encode `intent` here, and on ANY
    # failure drop it to "" (verification still runs, just without --intent) rather
    # than let a malformed value reach subprocess.run at all.

    # NOTE: this hook previously ran a `looks_like_vscode_window()` pixel heuristic
    # that BLOCKED every full VS Code window screenshot (dark left activity-bar
    # strip = block), forcing callers to crop to the preview pane/iframe. Removed
    # 2026-07-03 (HYP-891) at Alex's explicit direction: his tg#6041 standard made
    # full-window screenshots (Explorer/Inspector/Logs panels visible) the DEFAULT
    # desired HyperIDE diagnostic proof format, and the heuristic — which only
    # detected "is this a full window", not "is the preview inside it broken" —
    # hard-blocked that default, legitimate case at least twice in one day.
    #
    # KNOWN TRADEOFF (accepted, not solved): the `review visual --strict` call
    # below is the only remaining gate on a full-window shot, and it judges the
    # WHOLE image — the same limitation the original heuristic's author cited as
    # the reason a broken/unstyled preview pane could get visually diluted behind
    # busy editor chrome. That risk is real and UNVERIFIED either way (no
    # regression test proves `review visual` does or doesn't catch it on a full
    # window). Alex explicitly weighed this and chose to accept it rather than
    # keep gating the now-default proof format — see tg#6063/6064.
    #
    # INTENTIONAL: the watermark scan runs BEFORE the `review` PATH check
    # below, unlike the old fast-path order (review finding: `review`-absent
    # hosts now decode+sample every image, ~tens of ms, where they previously
    # did zero image work). Kept unconditional on purpose — the watermark
    # WARN is independently useful audit-trail signal ("this screenshot may
    # not show what the caption claims") regardless of whether the `review
    # visual` block-gate is even installed on this host, not something that
    # should silently go dark just because the OTHER check is unavailable.
