// Outbound text selection + history-record shaping for `tg replies`. PURE —
// the `tg` entrypoint knows the message body, attachment counts, and the ids
// Telegram assigned to what it just sent, and asks this module what to LOG.
// A photo/document-only send (no body) is logged with a placeholder so it
// still shows up in recall; a truly empty send (no body, no media — can't
// happen, the CLI rejects it) → null.

// A mixed-media send (transmit orders photos, then documents — see
// features/auto-attach/transmitter.ts) with an empty body needs BOTH counts
// in the placeholder. This is still a per-SEND label, not a per-message one —
// with buildOutboundHistoryRecords now writing one record per outbound id
// (review: tg-cli#131), EVERY id of a mixed send (photo AND document ids
// alike) gets this same combined text, so recall-by-id shows "what the whole
// send contained", not "what this specific id was". Before this fix an
// empty-body mixed send silently dropped the document count from the
// placeholder entirely (photos-only won the old priority check); the
// combined form is strictly more informative, not a precise per-id label.

// One `agent` history record PER outbound Telegram message_id — a send that
// splits into several Telegram messages (a >4096 split, or a media-group
// album) gets one record per id, all carrying the same text, so a reply
// anchored to ANY of those ids stays recall-able via `tg replies --json |
// select(.id == <tg#>)`. `buildReplyAnchor` (features/tg-ctl/updates.ts)
// stamps the reply-quote anchor with whichever id the CTO actually replied
// to — that can be any chunk/item, not only the first. Recording only the
// first id left later chunks unrecoverable (review: tg-cli#131). Falls back
// to a single `message_id: null` record when the send reported no ids at all
// (the `tg` entrypoint only calls this once TMUX_PANE is confirmed set, so in
// practice this is a successful send whose API response carried no
// message_id, not the outside-tmux case — that returns before ever reaching
// here. Unchanged from before this fix). Ids are de-duplicated (order
// preserved) so a caller that ever reports the same message_id twice (a
// retry, a defensive double-record) still logs exactly one history row per
// real Telegram message, matching routes.ts's own dedupe-by-id invariant
// (appendRoute) instead of a naive push.
//
// A TRUE multi-part send (2+ ids) stamps every sibling record with `groupId`,
// so `select.ts`'s reader can reconstruct "these N records are ONE logical
// send" from an authoritative write-time marker instead of guessing from
// coincidental field equality (same ts/text/pane) — the latter would wrongly
// merge two genuinely different messages sent in the same second with
// identical text (review: tg-cli#131 follow-up, closes #134). `groupId` is a
// CALLER-SUPPLIED opaque token (`tg` passes crypto.randomUUID()), not derived
// from `message_id`: Telegram's message_id is sequential PER CHAT, so reusing
// the first id as the group key could collide across two different chats
// sharing one bot's history file (same botId, different TG_CHAT_ID configs)
// — a random token makes that collision probability negligible regardless
// of chat topology. Keeping the token an injected parameter (like `ts`) —
// rather than generating it here with crypto.randomUUID() — keeps this
// function pure and deterministic for tests. A single-record send gets no
// groupId — nothing to group it with, so the token is simply unused.
