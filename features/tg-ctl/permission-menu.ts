// Parse a captured tmux pane's TEXT for Claude Code's numbered permission menu
// ("Do you want to proceed? \n ❯ 1. Yes \n 2. No") and pick which digit
// answers a given allow/deny decision.
//
// PURE — takes the raw `tmux capture-pane -pJ` output as a string, returns
// data. The tg-ctl entrypoint owns the actual capture (spawnSync) and the
// digit injection (features/tg-ctl/inject.ts's buildDigitInjectPlan).
//
// Why this exists: a PERMISSION request whose hook socket already closed
// (Claude Code's ~120s hook budget elapsed) has no live socket to write a
// structured JSON reply to — the harness has already fallen back to its OWN
// interactive terminal prompt. That prompt can still be answered directly by
// injecting the matching digit keypress, instead of queuing the decision and
// hoping a hook reconnect happens (which may never come — nothing about a
// terminal fallback causes Claude Code to fire a fresh hook). See tg-ctl's
// late-delivery-for-permissions path (tg-cli#267).
//
// CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-08-18, throwaway tmux session): a Bash-tool
// PermissionRequest renders exactly the "Do you want to proceed?" / numbered
// Yes-No menu this module parses, and a bare digit keypress submits it
// instantly (no Enter). NOT yet confirmed, tracked as tg-cli#268: edit/
// write-tool prompts ("Do you want to make this edit to …?") or
// plan-approval ("Would you like to proceed?" with "Yes, and auto-accept
// edits" / "No, keep planning" options) may use different marker text and/or
// option wording — those fall through to the existing queue-and-wait path
// today (parsePermissionMenu returns null / pickPermissionMenuDigit returns
// null for them), not because they're deliberately unsupported, but because
// they're unverified. Also tg-cli#268: the real rendered deny label may be a
// verbose form ("No, and tell Claude what to do differently") that
// pickPermissionMenuDigit's exact "No" match doesn't recognize — same safe
// fall-through.
//
// KNOWN LIMITATION: a command containing a real newline (heredocs, multi-
// line strings) can never satisfy permissionMenuMatchesRequest's per-line
// exact match, and always falls through to queuing — fail-soft, but it
// excludes some of the long-running commands most likely to blow the 120s
// hook budget in the first place.

// list much further down the pane, and silently un-bounded `context` below
// along with it). Once options begin, collects consecutive numbered lines

// normalized, equal the identity exactly? This is what actually closes the
// escalation case a naive substring/boundary check cannot: a stale "git

// --force" — as whole lines they are simply not equal, whereas ANY
// substring-style check (even boundary-aware) still finds "git push" sitting
// at the start of "git push --force" (review finding, confirmed by two
// independent reviewers as the concrete residual risk of a boundary-only
// fix). `tmux capture-pane -pJ` (capturePane) joins tmux's internal line-wrap
// breaks first, so a long command that LOOKS wrapped in the terminal is
// still one logical line by the time it reaches here.
