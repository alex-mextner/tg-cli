// Cross-process mutex around the routes-file read-modify-write (`tg recordRoute`).

// WHY: two agents racing a `tg` send each do read→appendRoute→write with NO
// coordination, so the second writer overwrites the first's just-added entry
// (last-writer-wins). The losing entry is exactly the origin→message_id mapping
// the daemon needs to recognize a reply — its loss is a second way a reply
// silently falls through to the wrong pane. Serializing the RMW makes every
// concurrent send's route survive (no lost updates).
//
// HOW: an O_EXCL lockfile is the cross-process mutex (atomic create, no bun:ffi
// needed — the daemon's flock binds to a long-lived fd, but `tg` is a short-lived
// CLI that holds the lock for ~1ms). `acquire` returns false when the lock is
// already held (O_EXCL EEXIST); we spin a bounded number of times with a small
// sleep. The body runs under `try/finally`, so a `tg` that completes ALWAYS
// releases — the only way a lock outlives its writer is a SIGKILL mid-RMW.
//
// STALENESS BY PID-LIVENESS, NOT MTIME: a stale lock is one whose OWNER PROCESS
// IS DEAD — never "older than N seconds". This is what makes break-then-acquire
// race-free: a LIVE writer's pid is alive, so its lock is never classified stale
// and never broken out from under it (the mtime-age approach had exactly that
// race — a slow-but-alive writer past the age window could be clobbered). The io
// reports the lock owner's liveness; only a dead owner's lock is removed.
//
// PURE/INJECTABLE: every effect (the RMW body, acquire/release, owner-liveness
// probe, break, sleep) is passed in, so this is unit-testable with no real files
// and the concurrency behavior is asserted deterministically. `tg` wires the real
// fs + `process.kill(pid, 0)`.
