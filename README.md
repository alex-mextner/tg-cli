# tg — Telegram bridge for AI coding agents

The best way to monitor several coding agents at once: they push only what matters — status updates, blockers, a question — and you reply from your phone. Agent questions and permission prompts arrive as **tappable inline buttons**; no terminal round-trip needed.

Works with any agent in tmux: Claude Code, Codex, opencode, aider, and more.

## What it looks like

**An agent finishes a task:**
```bash
tg --format html "<b>HYP-576 done</b>\nAll tests pass. PR #42 opened."
# → Telegram message with ticket title inlined, PR linked, agent emoji prefix
```

**An agent asks a question — arrives as buttons:**
```
[Claude 🤖] Should I delete the old migration files?
  [Yes, delete]  [No, keep them]
```
Tap a button. The answer injects directly into the agent's tmux pane.

**An agent sends a generated artifact:**
```bash
tg --file report.md "Weekly summary"
# .md files are auto-converted to PDF before upload
```

---

## Install

**One-liner** (installs deps via bun, links `tg` into PATH, registers the agent skill):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex-mextner/tg-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Register the skill manually** (idempotent; run automatically by the installer):
```bash
tg install-skill
```

`tg install-skill` makes agent harnesses aware of `tg`. It writes a skill file to
`~/.agents/skills/tg/` and, **for each detected harness**, appends a short always-on
blurb to its global instruction file (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`,
`~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`) and adds a Claude Code
`SessionStart` hook that surfaces installed agent CLIs at session start. All edits are
marked and idempotent — safe to re-run, and trivial to remove (delete the marked
blocks). Run automatically by the installer.

> Notes: the `SessionStart` hook prints the contents of `~/.agents/skills/.blurbs/*.md`
> into each session, so treat that directory as trusted (only the installers write there).
> `install-skill` is an exact-match subcommand — to send the literal text `install-skill`
> as a message, pipe it (`echo install-skill | tg -`) or add any other token.

**Manual clone:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alex-mextner/tg-cli.git
cd tg-cli
ln -sf "$(pwd)/tg" ~/.local/bin/tg
```

**Requirements:** [Bun](https://bun.sh)

**Config** — create `~/.config/tg-cli/.env`:
```
TG_BOT_TOKEN=<your bot token from @BotFather>
TG_CHAT_ID=<your chat or user ID>
```

### Update / deploy a merged change

`tg` is a committed Bun script run directly via the symlink (`tg` → `<checkout>/tg`),
so the checked-out file **is** the running binary — there is no build step. Deploying a
merged change is a fast-forward `git pull` in the checkout the symlink points at:
```bash
scripts/deploy.sh                  # update the checkout the `tg` on PATH points at
scripts/deploy.sh --dry-run        # show what would land, change nothing (always safe)
scripts/deploy.sh --checkout DIR   # update a specific checkout
```
When up to date the script is a no-op; otherwise it advances the checkout's `HEAD` to
`origin/<branch>`. It refuses to pull over tracked local changes (untracked files such
as a stray `node_modules` do not block it — though `git`'s own fast-forward will still
abort if an incoming path collides with an untracked file) and refuses a
non-fast-forward divergence. `tg` itself needs no restart — the next invocation reads
the new file. Exit codes: `0` up-to-date or deployed, `1` usage/environment error,
`2` non-fast-forward (needs a human).

> **`tg-ctl` daemon:** the inbound control daemon (`tg-ctl run`) loads its code into
> memory at start, so a deploy that changes daemon code (the `tg-ctl` entry or anything
> under `features/`, which the daemon imports) only takes effect after a restart — which
> **drops the daemon's pane/cwd/session registration**. `deploy.sh` detects this and prints exactly what to restart (re-binding
> the same pane); pass `--restart-ctl` to stop/start it automatically (re-register the
> pane afterwards). A plain `curl … | install.sh` re-run also refreshes a clone (it does
> `git pull --ff-only`), but does not handle the daemon.

## Outbound — agents push to Telegram

### Text and HTML reports

```bash
# Plain text (auto-detects agent, adds branded emoji prefix)
tg "Build finished, 0 errors"

# HTML — use Telegram's supported tag subset
tg --format html "<b>Status</b>\nAll checks green."

# HTML auto-detected when tags are present — --format html is optional
tg "<b>Important</b>: migration complete"
```

### Files, photos, and PDFs

```bash
tg --photo screenshot.png "Looks good"
tg --photo before.png --photo after.png "Comparison"
tg --file report.md "Weekly summary"    # .md auto-converted to PDF
tg --file data.csv --file chart.png "Results"
```

Markdown files (`*.md`, `*.markdown`) are silently converted to PDF via pandoc + headless Chrome before upload. On conversion failure the original file is sent instead — the send is never blocked. Requires `pandoc` and Chrome/Chromium 112+. Disable with `--no-feature md-as-pdf`.

### Auto-attach from message text

File paths mentioned in the message text are detected and attached automatically (images as photos, everything else as documents). The path token stays in the caption verbatim — it's only detected and attached, never removed. Recursive search across the worktree finds files by bare name or path suffix — `BFS`, shallowest match wins, `node_modules`/`.git`/`dist`-style dirs pruned.

### Secret-file denylist

Secret-looking files are **never** attached: `.env` family, SSH private keys, `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.p12`/`*.pfx`/`*.ppk`, credential rc-files (`.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.git-credentials`, …), shell histories, `*.tfvars`, `credentials.json`/`client_secret*.json`, `kubeconfig`. Auto-detected mentions are silently skipped; an explicit `--file prod.env` is a hard error. Override: `--no-feature attach-denylist`.

### Autolinks

**Linear tickets** (`HYP-576` style) — verified via the `linear` CLI, title inlined or appended. Requires `brew install schpet/tap/linear` + `linear auth login`. Disable: `--no-feature autolink-tasks`.

**GitHub PRs and issues** (`#42` style) — resolved against the cwd repo via `gh`. PRs get a state annotation (`(merged)`/`(open)`/`(draft)`). Disable: `--no-feature autolink-prs`.

Both features are ON by default. Both cache verdicts for 1 hour. Both degrade gracefully to plain text if the CLI is missing or not authenticated.

---

## Inbound — you reply from your phone

`tg-ctl` is the inbound daemon. It starts automatically on the first outbound `tg` send from a tmux pane with a detected agent. Stop it with `tg-ctl stop`.

### Sending a reply
Plain text from Telegram is injected into the agent's tmux pane as:
```
[TG from you] your message — reply via tg
```
The agent reads it and responds by calling `tg`.

**Reply with a quote (v1.6.0)** — reply to a message (optionally highlighting a
part of it) and the agent receives a quote anchor identifying what you answered:
`↩ tg#5975 «[date time] the quoted text…»` above your message. `tg#5975` is the
replied-to message's own Telegram id (tg-cli#130) — if the preview isn't enough
to place it (e.g. after the agent's context compacted), it can pull the full
original back with `tg replies`.

### Addressing a specific agent (v1.6.0)
With several agents running, `/agent <window> <message>` routes to one of them.
The window name is fuzzy-matched (phonetic, Cyrillic-aware), so `/agent апи deploy`
finds the `api-bot` window. If the target is ambiguous or omitted, you get inline
buttons grouped by tmux session; tap one to route. Bare `/agent` lists the agents.

### Q→buttons (v1.5.0, seamless setup in v1.6.0)
Agent questions and permission prompts are forwarded to Telegram as inline buttons — no need to touch the terminal. Tap to answer; the answer is injected back into the pane immediately. Supports Claude Code question/permission shapes, Codex `PermissionRequest`, and opencode `question.asked`/`permission.asked` events.

**Setup:** run `tg-ctl install-hooks` once — it idempotently wires the Claude Code hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` (backup first, existing hooks preserved), then restart the agent session. `tg-ctl status` reports q→buttons, StopFailure, and proactive statusLine usage telemetry separately, including project/local `statusLine` overrides that shadow the user-level collector. If you run `install-hooks` from such a project, it wraps that local statusLine too and backs the file up. (Codex/opencode: see the command's printed guidance.)

`tg-ctl harness-event` also accepts externally-piped proactive limit telemetry
from confirmed contracts: Claude Code statusLine `rate_limits` (and
`context_window` when called with `--agent claude`), Codex `token_count.rate_limits` / app-server
`account/rateLimits/*`, Pi RPC `get_session_stats.data.contextUsage.percent`
(with `--agent pi`), and an explicit `schema: "tg-cli.usageLimit.v1"` envelope
for custom collectors such as an OpenCode plugin. Native OpenCode token/cost
events are not treated as quota telemetry because they do not carry a
percentage/reset contract. `--agent` is a selector for agent-specific telemetry,
not just a display label: Claude `context_window` requires `--agent claude`, and
Pi session stats require `--agent pi`. When supported usage is **90% or higher**, tg-cli
sends a deduped Telegram warning in the detected user language (`--language`,
then `language`/`locale`/`user_language` payload fields, then `LANG`/`LC_*`);
if the language cannot be determined, the warning falls back to English.
Duplicate warnings for the same agent/limit are suppressed for the current reset
window, or for one hour when no reset is known.
Every supported telemetry sample is also saved as the latest snapshot for
`/limit [<agent>]`, even below the 90% warning threshold, so `/limit claude` can
show both `5-hour` and `weekly` buckets when Claude statusLine reports them.
For StopFailure compatibility, `--transcript` or a `transcript_path` payload with
no supported usage telemetry is treated as failure input and the last assistant
message in that transcript is scanned for the limit/error text.
`install-hooks` wires Claude StopFailure and Claude statusLine proactive telemetry
automatically. Existing visible statusLine output is preserved; when no statusLine
exists, the installed collector is silent. The collector samples statusLine payloads
at most every 30 seconds (`TG_CTL_STATUSLINE_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC=0` disables the
throttle for tests). Non-Claude proactive telemetry collectors must pipe their
payloads to `tg-ctl harness-event`.

While an agent is **waiting on a question**, new messages you send it are **deferred** (queued, marked ✍️ on the message) and delivered once the question is answered — they don't interrupt the prompt.
If the hook window closes or times out while the terminal prompt is still active,
the Telegram question is kept visible as an expired-timeout card: the old option
buttons are replaced with **Close**, and you can still reply to that card with
plain text to send the answer into the agent pane post-factum.

### Commands
| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/stop` | Inject Escape — interrupts the current agent turn, session survives |
| `/kill` | SIGINT the agent — session ends |
| `/status` | Report daemon state |
| `/limit [<agent>]` | Show the latest saved 5-hour/weekly/context usage telemetry for all agents or one agent |
| `/agent [<window>] <msg>` | Route a message to a specific agent (fuzzy window match, else selection buttons) |

Photos and documents sent from Telegram are downloaded to `~/.cache/tg-cli/inbound/` and the local path is injected for the agent to read.

A successfully handled message gets a 👀 reaction as a delivery receipt.

### Opt out
```yaml
# ~/.config/tg-cli/config.yaml
control:
  enabled: false
```

> **One bot token per machine.** Telegram allows a single `getUpdates` consumer per token. Outbound `tg` is unaffected.

### Forum topics — one topic per agent (opt-in, experimental)

When the bot chat is a **forum supergroup** (Topics enabled), tg-ctl can route per **topic**:
a message in topic *T* injects into that topic's bound agent pane. Opt in:

```yaml
control:
  topics: true   # default false — leave off for normal 1:1 routing
```

Default **OFF**: with the flag off, a forum-topic message falls through to the normal flat
routing, so existing 1:1 behaviour is unchanged. What's wired today is the **routing half** — an
inbound topic message routes to its bound pane.

Caveats while this is experimental:

- **Creating a topic spawns an agent.** A `forum_topic_created` starts the per-topic `/new` flow:
  the daemon asks for the working directory (offering recent project cwds as one-tap buttons, with a
  free-text fallback), then the model (catalog buttons), then `tmux new-window`s a fresh agent bound
  to that topic. Messages to the topic route to its pane; the agent's replies thread back.
- **An agent's own `tg` replies thread into their topic automatically.** A topic-spawned agent's
  window carries `TG_TOPIC=<id>` (stamped by the daemon at spawn), so a plain `tg "reply"` lands in
  the topic, not General — no `--topic` needed. (You can still pass `tg --topic <id>` / `TG_TOPIC`
  explicitly for a non-spawned shell; `TG_TOPIC` is *advisory* for **text / rich** sends — a stale or
  closed topic id falls back to General rather than hard-failing — whereas an explicit `--topic` is
  strict. A `--photo`/`--file`/album send with a stale env topic is NOT covered by that fallback.)
- **A dead topic offers a one-tap re-spawn.** If a topic's agent exits, the next message offers a
  *Re-spawn* button that re-launches with the retained project + model (or restarts setup if the dir
  vanished). A daemon restart re-binds a crash-orphaned agent to its topic instead of double-spawning.
- **Closing then reopening a LIVE topic does NOT re-attach its agent.** `forum_topic_reopened`
  drops the old pane binding and restarts the `/new` flow (re-pick model → re-spawn) rather than
  re-attaching the still-running original agent — so that agent keeps running untracked in its old
  pane until it idle-exits. Don't close/reopen a topic whose agent is mid-task; let it finish or
  send `/stop` first.

See `docs/specs/tg-forum-topics.md` (§9 increment plan) for the full design; increments 1–4 have landed.

### Recalling messages (`tg replies`, v1.11.0)

`tg replies` lets an agent (or you) quickly recall what was sent over Telegram —
with timestamps and `#message-ids` — without scrolling the pane.

```
tg replies [user|agent|all] [list | find <query>] [flags]
```

By default it shows the messages **you** sent in **this tmux session**, oldest
first:

```
$ tg replies
[2026-06-15 10:42] #4821 deploy the canary and watch error rates
[2026-06-15 10:58] #4827 roll it back, latency spiked
```

- **Direction** (1st positional, default `user`): `user` (what you sent),
  `agent` (what the agent sent via `tg`), or `all` (both, prefixed `←` you /
  `→` agent).
- **Action** (2nd positional, default `list`): `list`, or `find <query>` for a
  case-insensitive substring search (`--regex` for a regular expression).
- **Scope** defaults to the current pane's session; `--all-sessions` searches
  everywhere, `--session <window|paneId>` targets one scope — either a tmux
  **window name** (`--session ext`: exact match, all panes of every window named
  `ext` across sessions) or a raw pane id (`--session %7`).
- **Date range**: `--since <date>` / `--until <date>` keep only messages at or
  after / at or before the date (both inclusive). A date is an ISO date
  (`2026-06-28`, midnight UTC), an ISO datetime (`2026-06-28T10:00`, UTC), or
  relative (`3d` / `24h` — N days or hours ago from now).
- `-n/--limit N` (default 20, counts SENDS not raw rows — a >4096-char split
  or a media-group album is one send, never truncated mid-send), `--full`
  (no truncation), `--json` (a machine-readable array: `ts` ms, `id`,
  `direction`, `from`, `text`, `pane` — one row per Telegram message_id, so
  a multi-part send is several rows and `--json -n N` can return more than N
  rows), `--help`.

```
tg replies all                  # the full back-and-forth in this session
tg replies --session ext        # messages in the tmux window named "ext"
tg replies user find deploy     # your messages mentioning "deploy"
tg replies agent --all-sessions # everything the agent has sent, anywhere
tg replies user --since 3d      # your messages in the last 3 days
tg replies all --since 2026-06-28 --until 2026-06-30  # a date range
tg replies --json -n 5          # the last 5 sends, as JSON
```

History is an append-only `~/.config/tg-cli/tg-ctl.<botid>.history.jsonl` (one
JSON object per line, trimmed to the last ~5000 messages). The `tg-ctl` daemon
records inbound messages; `tg` records its own outbound. Both writers are
best-effort and never block a send or an inject.

---

## Agent branding

`tg` auto-detects which agent is running by walking the tmux pane's process tree and prefixes every message with the agent's custom emoji icon. No configuration needed.

<img src="emoji-icons/mini_claude.png" width="16" height="16" align="top" alt="Claude" /> <b>Claude</b> — Anthropic<br/>
<img src="emoji-icons/mini_codex.png" width="16" height="16" align="top" alt="Codex" /> <b>Codex</b> — OpenAI<br/>

<img src="emoji-icons/mini_hyperide.png" width="16" height="16" align="top" alt="HyperIDE" /> <b>HyperIDE</b><br/>

Branding follows the **model**, not the harness: a harness that runs an identifiable model is branded with that model's icon (so an opencode or router session shows whichever model it's driving — DeepSeek, Kimi, etc.). When no model can be determined, branding falls back to a 📁 folder icon. This is why the table above is keyed by model, not by tool.

**Detection precedence.** Explicit signals from the agent's environment (`TG_AI_MODEL`, then per-harness env vars) always take priority over `pgrep` process-tree fallbacks — so a stray background daemon (e.g. an `ollama` server running for unrelated reasons) can never shadow the real agent. Override anytime with `TG_AI_MODEL`.

Override if needed:
```bash
TG_AI_MODEL=kimi tg "message"
```

List all emoji helpers: `tg --ls-emoji-helpers`

Manual emoji in message text: `tg "done :codex: :gemini:"` — use any agent name as a `:name:` token.

See [docs/custom-emoji-system.md](docs/custom-emoji-system.md) for the full spec.

---

## Subagent identification (`--agent`)

Agent branding (above) identifies which MODEL is talking. It cannot tell apart an
orchestrator from the several subagents it fans work out to (Claude Code's Task tool
and equivalents) — a recipient sees a message with no way to know WHICH subagent sent
it, only that some AI did.

```bash
tg --agent hyperide-fixer "fixed the layout bug, PR #123 open"
# → ✳️ [window] [hyperide-fixer]
#   fixed the layout bug, PR #123 open
```

`--agent <label>` renders its own `[label]` bracket right after `[window]`, styled the
same way (Sans-Serif Bold, `<b>` fallback for Cyrillic). `TG_AGENT` is the env
equivalent — same precedence as `TG_AI_MODEL`: an explicit `--agent` flag wins, then
`TG_AGENT`, then auto-detection.

**Auto-detection today (investigated 2026-07-04): Claude Code only, and only
generic.** A Claude Code Task-tool subagent's own process carries
`CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION=1` — present ONLY in a subagent, never in the top-level
session — so `tg` auto-labels it `[subagent]` when no `--agent`/`TG_AGENT` is given.
This flag can say "some subagent sent this," never WHICH one: no per-agent id, type, or
task description reaches the child process env, and the shared `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`
is identical across every sibling subagent. **An orchestrator dispatching several
subagents should pass a descriptive `--agent <name>` itself** — auto-detection is a
floor, not a substitute. Codex CLI (checked: 0.142.4) and opencode (checked: 1.17.10)
expose no equivalent child/parent signal today; `--agent` is the only path there. Check
what the current shell would auto-detect: `tg --detect-agent`.

Note: `tg-ctl`'s OWN `--agent <name>` (used by `tg-ctl ask --agent codex` / `tg-ctl
harness-event`) is a DIFFERENT flag on a DIFFERENT binary — a closed harness-kind
selector (`claude`/`codex`/`opencode`/`pi`/`aider`) for classifying inbound hook/telemetry
payloads, not a free-form outbound sender label. The two never collide (separate argv
parsers), but don't confuse them.

## How tg compares

tg differs on three independent axes, which the tables below score separately:
- **Direction** — outbound-first (the agent *curates* what's worth sending) vs. inbound-first (a chat-driven remote terminal mirroring the session). Most tools are the latter; tg is the former.
- **Agent coverage** — any agent in tmux vs. Claude-only.
- **Control depth** — a thin, optional inbound layer (poke-back) vs. a full session mirror.

tg sits at outbound-first / any-agent / thin-inbound; the "remote terminal" tools cluster at inbound-first / Claude-only / full-mirror — but the axes are independent, which is why each column is scored on its own.

### Philosophy

| Tool | Direction | Mental model | Agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **tg** | Outbound-first, thin inbound | Curated agent reporting + poke-back | Any (multi-agent) |
| Anthropic Channels / Remote Control | Inbound-first | Remote terminal / chat bridge (first-party) | Claude only |
| Imolatte/tg-claude | Full-duplex | Remote terminal | Claude |
| oscarsterling/claude-telegram-remote | Full-duplex | Remote terminal (tmux) | Claude |
| RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram | Full-duplex | Remote terminal (SDK) | Claude |
| JessyTsui/Claude-Code-Remote | Full-duplex | Remote terminal + trace delivery | Claude |
| jsayubi/ccgram | Full-duplex | Approvals + remote terminal | Claude |

## Ecosystem

Part of the [HyperIDE.ai](https://hyperide.ai) agent toolchain:

- **[review-cli](https://github.com/alex-mextner/review-cli)** — agentic, priority-ordered failover multi-model code-review board (brainstorm/quorum, spec-web, dashboard)
- **[rig-cli](https://github.com/alex-mextner/rig-cli)** — umbrella dev-env driver: sets up a repo from config — skills, hooks, CI, dep-bootstrap; reconciles drift
- **[agent-tools](https://github.com/alex-mextner/agent-tools)** — the shared catalog `rig` applies: portable agent skills, agent-hooks, the global git-hook dispatcher, CI gates, and MCP servers
- **[draw-cli](https://github.com/alex-mextner/draw-cli)** — text-to-image via Hugging Face
- **[3d-cli](https://github.com/alex-mextner/3d-cli)** — scriptable CLI for the full 3D FDM lifecycle: modeling, mesh repair, slicing, and print monitoring
- **[hyperide.ai](https://hyperide.ai)** — Figma replacement inside VS Code. Edit React components directly through AST/LSP without AI hallucinations, token waste, or context-window limits. Works for indie vibe-coding and for enterprise teams with split design/dev roles.

Each CLI registers a skill into your agent harnesses (`<tool> install-skill`) so agents know it exists — see Install.
