# tg-ctl — Control Channel for tg-cli

- **Status:** Reviewed 2026-06-10 — multi-agent adversarial review (4 lenses; every
  blocker/major finding independently verified or refuted, two refuted by live
  experiment). Decisions D1–D4 resolved in §12; v1 scope in §16. Corrections are
  marked inline as "(corrected by review …)".
- **Date:** 2026-06-10
- **Branch:** `feat/tg-ctl-control`

## 1. Concept & goals

`tg-cli` today is a one-shot outbound sender (agent → Telegram). This spec adds a
thin, **optional inbound control path** so you can talk back to a running agent
session from Telegram — without turning `tg-cli` into a remote-terminal mirror.

**Philosophy (the differentiator):** moderated, agent-curated signal. The agent
already decides what is worth sending out (it calls `tg "..."` deliberately).
Inbound = inject a message/question into the live session; the answer comes back
**only** as what the agent explicitly sends (via `tg`, or a channel reply). No
full-session mirror, no scraped firehose, no completion-detection heuristics.

**Goals:**
- Send a message from Telegram into a running, **normally-started** agent session.
- Get a curated answer back (agent calls `tg`, or replies via channel).
- Forward agent-initiated questions / permission prompts to Telegram, answerable
  with inline buttons.
- Two transports: **tmux/poll (primary)** and **Channel (deferred experiment, v1.2+)**
  — priority inverted by review, see §3/§12 D1.
- Single daemon, strictly **singleton**, lazily auto-started by `tg`.

## 2. Non-goals (explicit)

- **No completion / Stop-hook detection** — CC Stop hooks false-fire; rejected by design.
- **No full-session streaming / terminal mirror** — that is `/rc` and every competitor.
- **No screen-scraping** (`capture-pane`) for the round-trip.
- **No arbitrary remote shell** — the only injection target is the agent session.

## 3. Architecture overview

**Components:**
- `tg` (existing one-shot sender) — outbound unchanged; gains a guarded lazy
  auto-start of `tg-ctl`.
- `tg-ctl` — the control daemon / channel server. One binary, two modes:
  - **Poll mode (primary):** standalone daemon, long-polls Telegram
    `getUpdates`, injects into the target tmux pane via `send-keys` /
    `paste-buffer`. Photo/file inbound works here too via `getFile` download
    (corrected by review F6 — media was never channel-only).
  - **Channel mode (deferred, v1.2+):** runs as a Claude Code channel (MCP
    server) spawned by `claude`. Owns Telegram I/O; inbound-only (outbound stays
    `tg`, §4).
- **Hook installer** — writes the question/permission-forwarding hooks into
  `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**Transport selection / priority (corrected by review F3/F5):**
- **Poll/tmux is the primary transport**, not the fallback. "Channel has
  priority" was unenforceable as designed: the flock is first-come-first-served,
  so a poll daemon already holding the lock silently kills a later channel
  instance (it fails the lock and exits 0 — channel dead until a manual
  `tg-ctl stop`), and the spec's own "restart with channels" advice walked
  straight into that deadlock.
- If a channel instance ever owns the bot, poll-mode `tg-ctl` must **not** also
  poll (avoids Telegram 409, the competitor bug class #36800) — both modes take
  the same singleton lock keyed on the bot token (§6). A takeover protocol
  (channel reads pidfile → SIGTERM the poll daemon → bounded wait → acquire) is
  specced together with channel mode in v1.2+.

## 4. Round-trip mechanic

- **Poll/tmux mode:** `tg-ctl` injects the inbound message **wrapped**:
  `[TG from <name>] <message> — reply via tg`. The agent does the work and calls
  `tg "answer"` (curated, branded). Loop closes with no scrape, no completion hook.
- **Channel mode:** the message arrives as a native `<channel>` event, wrapped the
  same way (`… — reply via tg`). **Outbound is always `tg`** — one branded, curated
  voice. The channel is **inbound-only** (one-way channels are supported); we do not
  implement a channel reply tool, so there is never a second, unbranded outbound
  format. Photo/file inbound is delivered as a downloaded path the agent can read.
  Trade-off: a channel reply tool would give native threading / typing indicators but
  would lose `tg`'s branding / auto-attach — rejected to keep a single voice (see D2, §12).

## 5. Transports

### 5.1 Channel (priority)

- **Recommendation: build our own custom inbound-only channel** (an MCP server
  implementing the channel protocol), not the official plugin. Rationale: the official
  plugin is a two-way bridge whose `reply` is the generic, unbranded voice we avoid;
  an inbound-only channel pushes messages in, leaves all outbound to `tg`, and shares
  the singleton lock so it can't double-poll the bot.
- **Risk:** custom channels ride `--dangerously-load-development-channels`
  (research preview, gated) with known preview bugs (#40064 permission relay,
  #36800 duplicate instances / 409). Document and keep poll/tmux as the stable
  fallback.
- **Alternative (faster, less control):** reuse `telegram@claude-plugins-official`
  and run `tg-ctl` in poll/tmux only when the official channel is absent.
  **DECISION DEFERRED TO REVIEW (§12).**
- **Capabilities (inbound-only):** inbound text + photo/file (auto-download). Outbound
  stays exclusively `tg`. Photo/file is the channel-only capability tmux cannot match.
  A one-way (inbound) channel is explicitly supported by the protocol, so no reply tool
  is implemented.
- **Launch (corrected by review EXT-2):** `claude --channels` alone does NOT load
  a development channel — the working invocation is
  `claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:<name>`. The channel
  server is spawned by `claude` as a subprocess; its lifetime equals `claude`'s.
- **Deferred to v1.2+ (review D1):** research-preview flag with consent dialogs,
  preview bugs #36800/#40064, and no `bun test`-able e2e (the claude-spawned path
  is manual-only; the MCP-protocol layer itself IS testable with a fake host —
  see §11). Poll/tmux covers v1 including media inbound (§5.2).

### 5.2 tmux (fallback + control verbs)

- **Target discovery (corrected by review F2/F7):** target a concrete **pane id**
  (`%N`), never a session name — a session's active pane may be a shell prompt,
  where injected text + Enter would EXECUTE as a command. Sources: the
  registration snapshot `tg` hands over at auto-start (`TMUX_PANE` + cwd), plus
  outside-in discovery by walking the process tree under `pane_pid` from
  `tmux list-panes -a` (note: a Claude Code pane reports its VERSION string as
  `pane_current_command`, e.g. `2.1.150`, not `claude` — match the `claude`
  child process under `pane_pid`, verified live). Before EVERY injection,
  re-verify the pane still hosts the agent process; refuse + reply in TG
  otherwise. `tg`'s own env-based `detectAiModel` does NOT transfer to the
  daemon (it relies on inherited session env) — only the snapshot does.
- **Injection (proven recipe, extracted from competitor source):**
  - Single-line: `tmux send-keys -t <pane> -l "<text>"` — literal mode
    (special-char safe).
  - Multi-line: `tmux load-buffer -` + `tmux paste-buffer -p -t <pane>`
    (bracketed paste). Live experiment showed Claude Code treats a literal
    `send-keys -l` LF as "insert newline" (review F10 refuted the submit-early
    fear for CC specifically), but bracketed paste is the universally safe path
    across the tmux floor (canonical-mode REPLs DO submit on LF).
  - `sleep ~0.5s` (competitor source uses 0.5s, not 0.4s).
  - `tmux send-keys -t <pane> Enter`.
  - Text and Enter are **separate** calls with a gap — a combined/too-fast Enter is
    dropped by the Ink TUI (the single most common failure in the other bots).
  - Control verbs (raw keys, no `-l`): `Escape` (exit picker), `BTab` (cycle
    permission mode).
- **`/stop` / interrupt (corrected by review EXT-1):** `tmux send-keys -t <pane>
  Escape` — interrupts the current turn, the session survives (verified live on
  CC 2.1.170). A single `kill -SIGINT <claude-pid>` KILLS the interactive
  `claude` process (~1s, idle or mid-turn) — it is reserved for an explicit
  `/kill` verb whose TG reply says "session killed — restore via
  `claude --resume`". The pid comes from the registered pane's process tree,
  never a global `pgrep -f claude` (matches every claude on the machine).
- **Photo/file inbound works in poll mode (corrected by review F6):**
  `getUpdates` delivers `file_id` → `getFile` download (≤20 MB; polite size
  error above) into `~/.cache/tg-cli/inbound/<update_id>.<ext>` (daemon-chosen
  filename, never Telegram-supplied) → inject the wrapped local path. The old
  "restart with channels" reply is dropped — media was never channel-only.
  Channel mode's residual advantages are only: works without tmux, and native
  event delivery instead of keystroke fragility.
- **No-tmux guard:** inbound arrives but `claude` not in tmux / no session → reply
  in TG: "Claude Code not in tmux → feedback won't work. Relaunch:
  `tmux new -s claude 'claude'`."

## 6. Singleton / idempotency (HARD requirement)

- **Exactly one poller per bot token.** Never two `tg-ctl` instances; never
  poll-mode + channel-mode polling the same bot.
- **Mechanism (pinned by review F1/F2/F4 — F1 was the blocker):** non-blocking
  `flock(2)` on `~/.config/tg-cli/tg-ctl.<botid>.lock`, held for the daemon's
  lifetime. Neither Bun nor Node expose flock and macOS has no `flock(1)` CLI,
  so the implementation is `bun:ffi`: `dlopen` of `libSystem.B.dylib` (darwin) /
  `libc.so.6` (linux), symbol `flock(i32, i32)`, `LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB = 6`, fd kept
  open for the daemon's lifetime — the kernel releases the lock on ANY exit,
  including SIGKILL (verified working on this machine, contention included).
  A second start fails the `flock` → exits 0 (idempotent no-op). PID file
  `tg-ctl.<botid>.pid` is purely informational for `status`/`stop`; stale
  pidfile cleared via `kill -0`.
- **Launcher/daemon split (review F1, blocker):** `tg-ctl start` (and the lazy
  auto-start from `tg`) spawns the daemon with
  `{detached: true, stdio: ['ignore', logFd, logFd]}` + `unref()` and exits
  immediately, WITHOUT taking the lock. The daemon process itself (internal
  `tg-ctl run`) opens the lockfile and takes the flock as its FIRST action,
  exiting 0 on failure. Rationale, both verified on Bun 1.4.0: (a) flock is
  bound to the open file description — a launcher-held lock dies with the
  launcher, opening a two-daemon window; (b) piped/inherited stdio makes the
  launcher (and therefore every agent `tg` call) hang for the daemon's entire
  lifetime.
- Channel mode takes the **same** lock (our custom channel can — a reason to prefer
  custom over official). If the lock is held by a channel instance, poll-mode
  auto-start is a no-op.
- **Race:** two concurrent `tg` calls both attempt auto-start → `flock` serializes;
  the loser exits.
- **Scope boundary (local-only):** `flock` guarantees one `tg-ctl` per *machine*.
  Telegram `getUpdates` allows one consumer per bot token *globally* — two machines
  polling the same `TG_BOT_TOKEN` → 409. So inbound control is **one machine per bot
  token**; multi-machine fleets need a bot-per-machine or a central router (D3, §12).
  Outbound `tg` (`sendMessage`) is unaffected — it works from any number of machines.

## 7. Lifecycle & auto-start

- **Commands:**
  - `tg-ctl start` — spawn the detached daemon and exit (no lock here — §6).
    No-op if already running.
  - `tg-ctl run` — internal: the daemon itself. flock first, then poll loop.
  - `tg-ctl stop` — read pidfile, `SIGTERM`, clean pidfile.
  - `tg-ctl status` — running? mode? target pane? bot id? last update age?
- **Lazy auto-start from `tg`:** on `tg` invocation, auto-start `tg-ctl` **only if both hold**:
  - inside a tmux pane (`TMUX` set) with a detected AI agent, **and**
  - config `control.enabled: true`.
  - **No TTY check.** The agent calls `tg` through Claude Code's Bash tool with stdout
    piped, so `isatty` is false in the *exact* scenario we want to fire — a TTY gate
    would kill the headline trigger. The `TMUX` check already excludes CI/cron (no
    `TMUX` there), doing the protective work without breaking the feature. (Verify
    `isatty` under the Bash tool before relying on this.)
  - **Cleaner alternative / complement:** a `SessionStart` hook starts `tg-ctl` once
    when `claude` launches in tmux, instead of on every `tg` call. Auto-start-from-`tg`
    stays as a fallback; both are idempotent via `flock`.
- Auto-start is fire-and-forget and idempotent (`flock` guarantees a single instance).

## 8. Question / permission forwarding (the only hooks)

Core handoff shipped in `tg-ctl`: a hook process runs `tg-ctl ask`, writes a
normalized question/permission JSON request on stdin, and waits on the running
daemon over a bot-scoped Unix domain socket (`tg-ctl.<botid>.sock`). The daemon
sends Telegram inline buttons, consumes `callback_query` updates in the same
poll stream as messages, immediately `answerCallbackQuery`s every tap, edits
answered/expired prompt messages, and returns agent-specific JSON to the hook
client. A missing daemon/socket or timeout returns no decision so the local
agent UI takes over. The daemon also checks the hook request against the active
registration: `paneId` is authoritative — when both sides know the pane, a
mismatch fast-passes even if `cwd`/`sessionName` agree (a second keyboard
session in the same cwd must never block on Telegram); `cwd` and `sessionName`
match only when the pane is unknown on either side. Mismatches fast-pass with
no Telegram prompt so globally installed hooks cannot block unrelated keyboard
sessions.

Hardening: the daemon `chmod 0600`s the socket on listen (the guard trusts
client-supplied fields, so other local users must not reach it); hook requests
are capped at 64 KiB per connection; a tap is matched against the prompt's own
Telegram `message_id`, so a stale tap on an earlier message that reused the
callback key answers "expired" instead of resolving a later hook (skipped only
while `sendMessage` is in flight — that race resolves in the tap's favor).

Claude Code hook installation remains an automation layer over that handoff
(backup first):
- `PreToolUse` matcher `AskUserQuestion` → call `tg-ctl ask` with question +
  options → return
  `{hookSpecificOutput:{hookEventName:"PreToolUse", permissionDecision:"allow",
  updatedInput:{...tool_input, answers:{<q>:<label>}}}}`. `hookEventName` is
  REQUIRED here too (tg#5741): Claude Code (verified on 2.1.198) validates hook
  JSON output and DISCARDS the entire output when `hookSpecificOutput` lacks it
  ("hookSpecificOutput is missing required field hookEventName"), so the card
  reads "answered" while the agent falls back to the local dialog. `updatedInput`
  echoes the ORIGINAL `tool_input` (CC schema-validates it wholesale against the
  tool's input schema — option `description` is a required field there, previews
  must survive) with the collected `answers` merged in; the rebuilt-from-request
  shape remains only as the fallback for manual callers that carry no tool_input.
  A MULTI-question call (2-4 questions, the tool's schema cap) forwards as one
  SEQUENTIAL card per question — each with a `(i/N)` title suffix and its own
  stable per-question requestId (replay/reconnect dedup unchanged) — and the ask
  client composes ONE combined reply from the collected answers. ALL-OR-NOTHING:
  any multiSelect/free-form question, or any declined/timed-out card, bails the
  whole call to the local UI — a PARTIAL answers record must never be emitted
  (once a hook supplies `updatedInput` no dialog is shown, so CC would silently
  record the unanswered questions as "(no option selected)"). For the same
  reason a set member is never LATE-DELIVERED: once the local dialog takes over
  it owns ALL the questions, and injecting one lone late answer could answer
  the WRONG prompt — a late tap on an abandoned member answers "expired" and
  retires the card (reconnect re-attach across a daemon bounce still works). The client also
  REPAIRS a single-question reply from a stale RUNNING daemon that predates
  `hookEventName` (live-symlink deploys update the hook client before the
  daemon restarts).
- `PermissionRequest` → call `tg-ctl ask` with tool + args → Approve/Reject
  buttons → return
  `{hookSpecificOutput:{decision:{behavior:"allow"|"deny"}}}`.
- **Plan-approval (`ExitPlanMode`)** is the harness BLOCKING plan-mode prompt
  (ROADMAP "Forward harness confirmation / permission prompts to TG"). It is
  recognized by `tool_name === "ExitPlanMode"` and forwarded as a permission with
  **relabeled buttons — Proceed (allow) / Keep planning (deny)** — carrying the
  plan text in the message body (clamped to stay inside Telegram's 4096-char
  limit). It gets **NO dedicated PreToolUse matcher**: per the live hooks docs
  BOTH `PreToolUse` and `PermissionRequest` can fire for the same ExitPlanMode
  call, so a second matcher would double-forward the plan (and leave the losing
  `tg-ctl ask` blocked until timeout). The `PermissionRequest *` catch-all already
  delivers it exactly once. The hook reply shape follows the event that fired —
  the request carries `permissionEvent`, and `tg-ctl ask` returns
  `{hookSpecificOutput:{hookEventName:"PermissionRequest",decision:{behavior}}}`
  for `PermissionRequest` — on a relabeled deny the keep-planning reason rides
  `decision.message` (the live hooks reference documents it "for deny only: tells
  Claude why the permission was denied" — the MODEL-facing channel, unlike
  top-level `systemMessage`, which is user-only). vs
  `{hookSpecificOutput:{hookEventName:"PreToolUse",permissionDecision,
  permissionDecisionReason?,updatedInput?}}` for `PreToolUse` (deny carries the
  tapped label as `permissionDecisionReason` so the model gets the keep-planning
  intent). `hookEventName` is REQUIRED in `hookSpecificOutput`. For a PreToolUse
  ALLOW of ExitPlanMode the live hooks docs require `updatedInput` ALONGSIDE allow
  ("Returning allow alone is not sufficient for these tools"), so the original
  `tool_input` is echoed back unchanged as `updatedInput` (all confirmed against
  the live hooks docs).

Codex uses the same `tg-ctl ask` handoff for `PermissionRequest` and returns
the documented Codex shape:
`{hookSpecificOutput:{hookEventName:"PermissionRequest",decision:{behavior:"allow"|"deny"}}}`.
Codex hooks still require manual trust via `/hooks` on first run.

These work **without** channels (pure hook return-value path). **No completion/Stop
hook.** The hook process awaits the button answer over the UDS request/response
path with a hard client-side timeout.

**Verification status (review F5/F7 — live spike PASSED on CC 2.1.170):** a
PreToolUse hook on `AskUserQuestion` returning
`{hookSpecificOutput:{permissionDecision:"allow", updatedInput:{questions,
answers:{<question text>:<label>}}}}` pre-answers the question with NO dialog
rendered — the mechanism works as written. Caveats that go into the
implementation: `answers` is keyed by the QUESTION TEXT (not header); multiSelect
answers are a comma-joined string; `updatedInput` replaces the input wholesale so
it MUST include `questions`; and the contract is an UNDOCUMENTED internal of the
permission component — add a canary e2e (synthetic payload against a real
`claude -p`) that fails loudly on contract drift. The `PermissionRequest` shape
(`hookSpecificOutput.decision.behavior`) is documented and exact.

**Contract drift CONFIRMED (tg#5741, CC 2.1.198):** the predicted drift happened —
2.1.198 hard-requires `hookEventName` inside `hookSpecificOutput` (its hook-output
parser rejects the whole output otherwise, with the dedicated error
"hookSpecificOutput is missing required field hookEventName"), so the 2.1.170-era
question envelope silently stopped delivering answers: the daemon logged
`ask-answered`, the card read "answered: <label>", and the agent still opened the
local dialog. The envelope now stamps `hookEventName:"PreToolUse"` and echoes the
original `tool_input` (2.1.198 also schema-validates `updatedInput` wholesale;
unknown keys are tolerated, missing required option `description` is not). The
`answers` field is part of the tool's input schema on 2.1.198 ("User answers
collected by the permission component"), and the tool's `call()` returns
`input.answers` directly — a complete record finishes the tool with zero local
keypresses, including the multi-question case (previously: local dialog + the
extra final Enter). The deferred canary is still worth adding.

**Timeout semantics (review F6):** set an explicit per-hook `timeout` (~120 s) in
settings.json; the daemon's own deadline is slightly shorter. On expiry the hook
returns NO decision → the normal local dialog takes over; the daemon edits the TG
message to "expired — answer in terminal". Late button taps get
`answerCallbackQuery("expired")`; every callback_query is acked with
`answerCallbackQuery` immediately (review EXT-5 — otherwise the client spins).
The daemon must also expire the TG message when the hook process dies (local
Esc abort), not only on timeout.

**Shipped core path (user request 2026-06-10):** UDS protocol, inline buttons,
callback routing, expiry editing, Claude/Codex hook output formatting, opencode
adapter helpers, and `pi` limited-status handling. Deferred: idempotent hook
installer, Claude canary test, and long-running opencode SSE ownership.

**Fast-passthrough guard (critical):** these hooks live in `~/.claude/settings.json`
and fire for **every** Claude Code session, including keyboard sessions with no
Telegram. They MUST return *no decision* instantly unless **(a)** `tg-ctl` is running
**and (b)** this session is the active TG-control target (matched by tmux session / cwd
via a registration file written by `tg-ctl`). Otherwise they passthrough with zero added
latency — a normal keyboard session, or any session with no `tg-ctl`, is never blocked,
delayed, or hung waiting for a button tap.

## 9. Config

- `~/.config/tg-cli/.env`: `TG_BOT_TOKEN`, `TG_CHAT_ID` (existing).
- **Allowlist (corrected by review F13): sender user ids**, not chat id —
  checked on `message.from.id` AND `callback_query.from.id`. Default:
  `TG_CHAT_ID` (correct for DMs, where they coincide); optional
  `control.allowed_senders` for extras. Gating on chat id alone would let any
  member of a group chat inject prompts into the agent session.
- `config.yaml` — a new `control:` block. NOTE (review F1/repo-fit): the existing
  feature-flag parser reads only a boolean `features:` block; `control.*` needs
  its own tiny parser in the same hand-rolled style (strings + booleans + ints,
  one nesting level, no yaml dependency):
  - `control.enabled`: bool, default `true` (flipped from `false` by user
    decision 2026-06-10 post-review) — gates inbound + auto-start. Inbound is
    armed out of the box; opt OUT per machine with `enabled: false`. This makes
    D3 (bot-per-machine) a practical requirement, not just a recommendation.
  - `control.transport`: `auto | tmux` in v1 (`channel` reserved for v1.2+),
    default `auto`.
  - `control.session`: optional fixed tmux session name (else auto-discover).
  - `control.inject_wrap`: template, default `[TG from {name}] {msg} — reply via tg`.
  - `control.staleness_sec`: int, default `300` — inbound older than this is
    dropped on arrival (§10).
  - `control.idle_exit_min`: int, default `30` — daemon exits when no agent pane
    has existed for this long (§10).
  - `control.allowed_senders`: comma-separated extra sender ids.
- `TG_API_BASE` (env, default `https://api.telegram.org`) — injectable Bot API
  base URL; exists so tests can point the spawned daemon at a local fake
  (review F12).

## 10. Error handling / edge cases

- Bot token shared by `tg` (`sendMessage`) and `tg-ctl` (`getUpdates`): `sendMessage`
  does not conflict with the long-poll; only one `getUpdates` consumer is allowed →
  enforced by the singleton.
- **Offset persistence & delivery semantics (added by review F4):** persist the
  last-confirmed `update_id` per bot id in `~/.config/tg-cli/tg-ctl.<botid>.offset`,
  shared between modes so a future handover doesn't replay. Semantics:
  **at-most-once** — advance the offset BEFORE acting on an update. A crash
  between confirm and inject loses that message (the human notices no response
  and resends); the alternative (at-least-once) double-injects ghost prompts
  into a live agent session, which is strictly worse for a control channel.
- **Stale flood (review F4):** offset persistence does NOT stop the 24 h Telegram
  backlog accumulated while the daemon was down. Drop every inbound whose
  `message.date` is older than `control.staleness_sec` (default 300 s) and send
  ONE summary notice: "skipped N stale messages".
- **409 in the poll loop (review F9):** exponential backoff with cap; after N
  consecutive 409s send one TG/log notice "another consumer is polling this bot"
  and idle. The flock cannot prevent a lingering server-side long poll right
  after a restart, nor a consumer on another machine.
- **Idle TTL (review F12):** if no agent pane has existed for
  `control.idle_exit_min` (default 30 min), exit cleanly — lazy auto-start
  resurrects the daemon on the next `tg` call. No stray processes.
- **Delivery receipts (user request 2026-06-10):** every inbound message whose
  handling fully succeeded gets a **👀 reaction** (`setMessageReaction`,
  best-effort) — the human sees at a glance that the message landed in the
  session. Every failure path replies with an error instead (no-agent,
  ambiguous target, inject abort, kill/download failures, too-large media);
  a failed message NEVER gets the reaction. Stale-dropped and
  disallowed-sender messages get neither.
- `claude` not running → inbound reply: "no active session".
- Multiple tmux sessions with `claude` → pick the one matching the registration
  snapshot (pane id), else `control.session`, else most recently active agent
  pane; if still ambiguous, reply in TG naming the candidates (buttons arrive
  with v1.1 hooks work).
- Channel preview bugs → poll/tmux is the primary transport (§3).
- send-keys into an open picker → optional `Escape` prelude (configurable), matching
  oscarsterling.
- Hook fires but `tg-ctl` is not running, or this session is not the TG-control target
  → **fast passthrough**, no decision, no latency (§8). A keyboard session is never blocked.

## 11. Testing (corrected by review F3/F12)

- **Unit (pure modules, injected I/O):** arg parse; config `control:` block
  parsing; update→action step function (allowlist, staleness, command split,
  offset advance); inject plan building (single-line, multi-line, control
  verbs); discovery from canned `list-panes` + process-tree output.
- **Process-level (NOT unit — it spawns real processes):** flock singleton —
  spawn two `tg-ctl run` against a tmpdir lock path, assert exactly one
  survives, assert the loser exits 0.
- **Auto-start gating:** the skip test asserts on **no `TMUX`**, not no TTY —
  §7 explicitly mandates NO TTY gate (the old "no-TTY auto-start skip" test
  item contradicted §7 and is gone).
- **Integration (tmux, `test.skipIf(!tmuxAvailable)`):** throwaway tmux session
  running a stub TUI (a tiny Bun readline script); assert single-line
  `send-keys -l` + delayed `Enter` lands one submission; assert a 3-line
  message via `load-buffer`/`paste-buffer -p` lands as ONE submission; assert
  the `Escape` verb. Tests MAY use `capture-pane` for assertions — the §2 ban
  is on the production round-trip only.
- **No live Telegram in CI:** a local `Bun.serve` fake of the Bot API
  (`getUpdates`/`sendMessage`/`getFile`), reached via `TG_API_BASE` (§9); the
  daemon is spawned as a real subprocess against the fake.
- **Hook (v1.1):** feed a synthetic `AskUserQuestion` payload on stdin; assert
  correct `updatedInput` JSON after a simulated button answer; plus the canary
  e2e against a real `claude -p` for contract drift (§8).
- **Channel (v1.2+):** the MCP-protocol layer is testable with a fake host
  (spawn `tg-ctl`, JSON-RPC initialize, assert
  `capabilities.experimental['claude/channel']`, feed a fake update, assert the
  channel notification); the claude-spawned e2e is manual-only.

## 12. Decisions (RESOLVED by review, 2026-06-10)

- **D1 — RESOLVED: custom inbound-only channel, but deferred to v1.2+.** When
  built, it is the custom inbound-only channel (one branded voice, shares the
  singleton lock; one-way channels are officially supported — omit
  `capabilities.tools`), NOT the official two-way plugin: the official plugin
  owns the bot's update stream, which silently breaks hook-button routing
  (review F8) and double-forwards permissions. Channel mode is demoted from
  "priority" to a config-gated experiment for the research preview's duration
  (permanent `--dangerously-load-development-channels`, consent dialogs, bugs
  #36800/#40064 — both confirmed real). A side fact in the design's favor:
  #40064 breaks the native channel permission relay for `server:` channels, and
  this spec routes permissions through hooks anyway, so the bug is contained.
- **D2 — RESOLVED: `tg`-only outbound.** Matches the repo's positioning
  (curated, branded outbound IS the moat), reuses auto-attach/limits/branding
  for free, avoids a second unbranded voice and a second outbound codepath.
- **D3 — RESOLVED: bot-per-machine.** Config-only (one BotFather call per
  machine), keeps "one lock = one bot = one machine" exactly right. A central
  router is a new always-on service with its own SPOF — defer until a real
  fleet need exists. README gets one sentence: "one bot token per machine for
  inbound". The 409 symptom of ignoring this is documented in §10.
- **D4 — UPDATED: v1 plus Q→buttons core.** v1 = `cc` via the tmux floor
  (poll daemon; §16). Hooks forwarding core (§8) is now shipped through
  `tg-ctl ask` + UDS + Telegram callbacks; opencode has pure native adapter
  helpers against the live 1.16.2 OpenAPI, while daemon-owned SSE subscription
  remains deferred. `/rename`, `/new`, `HarnessAdapter` → v1.2 (an
  interface with one implementation is premature). Channel mode → v1.2+.
  `codex` now supports `PermissionRequest` hook output; `pi`/`aider` stay on
  the tmux floor with honest limited replies. **`gemini` is dropped entirely**:
  Gemini CLI stops serving
  requests 2026-06-18; its successor (`agy`) gets a new row when verified.

## 13. Command layer

Telegram messages starting with `/` are commands; everything else is a prompt (§4).
Two commands are harness-aware; the rest pass through.

**v1 command set (review D4):** `/stop` (Escape inject — §5.2), `/kill` (SIGINT
to the registered pane's agent pid + "restore via `claude --resume`" reply),
`/status` (daemon + target info). `/rename` and `/new` ship in v1.2 with the
adapter layer; until then unknown `/cmd` passes through verbatim (below).

- **`/rename <name>`** — rename the harness session **and** the tmux window together:
  - tmux window: `tmux rename-window -t <pane> <name>` (universal).
  - harness session: via the adapter (§14) — CC `/rename <name>`; opencode
    `PATCH /session/{id}` `{title}`; harnesses without a rename → tmux window only, and
    the bot replies "session rename not supported for `<harness>` — renamed the tmux
    window only."
- **`/new [<name>]`** — reset the session and (re)name it:
  - reset via the adapter — CC `/clear`; opencode `POST /session` (fresh) / `session_new`;
    codex `/new`; aider `/reset`. Where reset is weak (gemini `/clear` clears only the
    screen), the bot says so.
  - if `<name>` is omitted **and** the harness supports naming → ask for a name in TG
    (free-text or buttons), then apply rename. If naming is unsupported → reset only.
- **Any other `/cmd …`** — passthrough verbatim into the harness:
  - TUI harnesses: inject `/cmd …` via `send-keys -l` + `Enter` (the harness interprets
    its own slash command).
  - opencode: `POST /session/{id}/command` (native), no keystrokes.

## 14. Multi-harness support

Inbound injection via tmux `send-keys` works for **any** terminal TUI; outbound stays
`tg` for any harness whose agent can run shell (it calls `tg` itself). On that universal
floor, each harness gets an **adapter** exposing native capabilities; where a capability
is missing, the bot states it plainly rather than faking it.

**`HarnessAdapter` interface:** `inject(text)`, `rename(name)`, `reset(name?)`,
`forwardQuestions()` (native | tmux-scrape | none), `detect()` (claim a running
process/pane). The CC adapter is the channel+hooks+tmux design of §5/§8; other adapters
plug into the same `tg-ctl` lifecycle.

**Capability matrix (verified June 2026; re-verified by review against the live
OpenAPI of opencode 1.16.2 at `GET /doc` — all opencode claims confirmed,
including `/question/{requestID}/reply`, `/permission/{requestID}/reply`, the v2
session question/permission reply routes, and the `question.asked` /
`question.v2.asked` / `permission.asked` / `permission.v2.asked` SSE events. Pin the
opencode version in the adapter and validate routes against the live `/doc` at startup:
v2 event variants signal churn. Codex caveat: its hooks must be explicitly trusted by
hash via `/hooks` — first run is manual. Gemini row kept for history only —
dropped per D4):**

| Harness | Native inject | Native question/perm forward | Rename | Reset | Feedback strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **opencode** (`oc`) | `POST /session/{id}/prompt_async` | **YES** — SSE question/permission events + reply endpoints | `PATCH /session {title}` | `POST /session` | **Native HTTP+SSE — best, no tmux** |
| **Claude Code** (`cc`) | tmux (no public inject API) | YES — hooks `PreToolUse`/`PermissionRequest`/`Notification` | `/rename` | `/clear` | hooks + channel + tmux |
| **Codex** | `codex exec` / app-server | YES — `PermissionRequest` hook | — | `/new` | hooks + tmux |
| **pi** | tmux | NO verified native API — no scraping | — | — | tmux + agent-calls-`tg`; Q→buttons says limited |
| **Aider** | `--message` (one-shot) | **NO** | — | `/reset` | tmux-only; bot says "limited" |
| **Gemini CLI** | `-p` | **NO** (retiring 2026-06-18 → Antigravity `agy`) | — | `/clear` (screen only) | tmux-only; bot says "limited" |

**opencode is the standout** — server-first (the TUI is one client of a local HTTP
server). The bot owns `opencode serve` on a fixed port; the user's TUI/web attaches to
it. The bot subscribes to `GET /event` (SSE), forwards legacy/v2 question and
permission events to Telegram as inline buttons, answers via `/question/{id}/reply`,
`/permission/{id}/reply`, or the v2 session-scoped question/permission reply routes.
No tmux, no scraping, no core patch (it's MIT and accepts PRs, but none is needed). A
single single-select `QuestionInfo` with concrete `options[]` and `custom: false` maps
to Telegram buttons; multi-question, multi-select, and free-form prompts fall back
until the bot has a multi-answer UI. Caveat: a user-launched TUI binds a random port
unless started with a fixed `--port` (or discovered via `--mdns`) — so the clean path is
"bot owns the server, clients attach", not "inject into an arbitrary TUI".

**The "not supported" rule:** when a harness lacks native question-forwarding (aider,
gemini, pi-for-now), the bot does NOT silently scrape-and-hope; it forwards what tmux can
see and replies once: "native question forwarding isn't available for `<harness>` —
inbound works, but I can't reliably forward its prompts; answer in the terminal."

**Detection:** reuse `tg`'s existing process/pane detection (it already brands by model)
to pick the adapter; `pgrep` / pane-command disambiguates cc vs opencode vs codex vs pi.

**Scope for v1:** ship `cc` (channel+hooks+tmux) and `opencode` (native) first-class;
`codex` (hooks+tmux) and `pi`/`aider`/`gemini` (tmux floor + honest "limited" replies) as
the long tail. See D4 (§12).

## 15. Out of scope / future

- Voice inbound, file-preview tunnels, multi-machine fleet routing, web dashboard
  (the monetization-hypothesis layer) — separate specs.

## 16. v1 scope (review verdict — what this branch implements)

**Integration with the repo (review F14):** `tg-ctl` is a second single-file
entrypoint at the repo root mirroring `tg` (`#!/usr/bin/env bun`,
`import.meta.main` guard, exported helpers so tests can import it). It shares
`tg`'s release: one `CHANGELOG.md` `## 1.4.0` section, `VERSION = "1.4.0"` in
`tg`. Deploy adds a `~/.files/bin/tg-ctl` symlink **after merge to main** (the
live-symlink rule: the main checkout IS the deployed tool). Pure logic lives in
`features/tg-ctl/` with injected I/O per AGENTS.md.

**v1 modules:**
1. `tg-ctl` (root) — thin wiring: `start`/`run`/`stop`/`status`, real flock via
   `bun:ffi` (§6), detached spawn, fetch loop against `TG_API_BASE`, real tmux
   spawns, `getFile` media download.
2. `features/tg-ctl/config.ts` — `control:` block parser (§9), pure.
3. `features/tg-ctl/lock.ts` — singleton decision logic (flock + kill-0
   injected), pidfile staleness, pure.
4. `features/tg-ctl/updates.ts` — pure step function:
   `(updates, state, now) → {actions, replies, newOffset}`; sender allowlist,
   staleness drop, command-vs-prompt split, media→download actions.
5. `features/tg-ctl/inject.ts` — pure: wrap template + tmux command plans as
   data (single-line `send-keys -l`, multi-line `load-buffer`/`paste-buffer -p`,
   separate delayed `Enter`, `Escape` verb, pre-inject pane verification step).
6. `features/tg-ctl/discover.ts` — pure: pick the target pane from injected
   `list-panes -a` output + process-tree info (cc shows VERSION as pane command
   — match the `claude` child under `pane_pid`).
7. `tg` wiring: ~20 gated lines — fire-and-forget auto-start after a successful
   send, only if `TMUX` is set AND `control.enabled: true`; hands over the
   `TMUX_PANE`/cwd registration snapshot.
8. Tests per §11 (unit + process-level singleton + skipIf tmux integration +
   `Bun.serve` Telegram fake).

**Shipped after v1 scope:** §8 hooks forwarding core (`tg-ctl ask` + inline
buttons + callback routing + UDS protocol) for Claude Code/Codex normalized
hook requests, plus opencode native adapter helpers and `pi` limited handling.
**Deferred:**
**reply-routing → v1.1** (user request 2026-06-10, after the first live
round-trip): `tg` records `message_id → {paneId, cwd}` into a routing map on
every outbound send; the daemon routes an inbound that carries
`reply_to_message` to the mapped pane, while plain (non-reply) text keeps the
v1 last-write-wins registration target. This turns one-bot-many-sessions into
a usable fan-in without threads; opencode daemon-owned SSE subscription → v1.1;
`/rename`, `/new`, `HarnessAdapter` → v1.2; channel mode + takeover protocol
→ v1.2+; the §10 Escape prelude is built in `inject.ts` but not wired (no
config key yet). Each deferral is annotated at its section.
