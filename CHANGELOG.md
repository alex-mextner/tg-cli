# Changelog

All notable changes to `tg` are documented here. This project adheres to
semantic versioning.

## 1.4.0

Inbound control v1 (`tg-ctl`, spec §16 — poll/tmux transport, ON by default;
opt out with `control.enabled: false`):

- New `tg-ctl` entrypoint at the repo root: `start` / `run` / `stop` / `status`.
  A singleton daemon long-polls Telegram `getUpdates` and injects inbound
  messages into the target agent's tmux pane, wrapped as
  `[TG from {name}] {msg} — reply via tg`. Outbound stays `tg`-only.
- Hard singleton via real `flock(2)` (`bun:ffi` → libSystem/libc): the launcher
  spawns the daemon detached and never takes the lock; the daemon flocks as its
  first action and exits 0 if another instance holds it.
- Lazy auto-start: a successful `tg` send from a tmux pane with a detected
  agent fire-and-forgets `tg-ctl start`, handing over the `TMUX_PANE`/cwd
  registration snapshot (gated on `control.enabled`).
- Pane-id targeting with pre-inject verification: the agent process is located
  by walking the pane's process tree (a Claude Code pane reports its version
  string, not `claude`, as the pane command); injection refuses + replies in
  Telegram if the pane no longer hosts an agent — text never lands in a shell.
- Commands: `/stop` (Escape inject — interrupts the turn, session survives),
  `/kill` (SIGINT + "restore via `claude --resume`"), `/status`; any other
  `/cmd` passes through verbatim; plain text is a wrapped prompt.
- Photo/document inbound: `getFile` download (≤20 MB) to
  `~/.cache/tg-cli/inbound/`, the local path is injected for the agent to read.
- Safety/robustness: sender-id allowlist, at-most-once offset persistence,
  staleness window (default 300 s) with a "skipped N stale" notice, 409
  backoff with a one-shot warning, idle TTL (default 30 min), multi-line
  injection via bracketed paste.
- Delivery receipts: a successfully handled inbound message gets a 👀
  reaction; every failure answers with an error reply instead.
- Config: new `control:` block (`enabled`, `transport`, `session`,
  `inject_wrap`, `staleness_sec`, `idle_exit_min`, `allowed_senders`).
  One bot token per machine for inbound (Telegram allows a single `getUpdates`
  consumer); outbound `tg` is unaffected.
- Deferred (recorded in the spec): question/permission forwarding with inline
  buttons (v1.1), opencode native adapter (v1.1), `/rename`+`/new` (v1.2),
  channel mode (v1.2+), configurable Escape prelude.

Also in this release:

- New `recursive-attach` feature (ON by default): a file mentioned by bare
  name or path suffix that misses plain and worktree-root resolution is now
  found recursively under the worktree roots (or cwd outside a git repo) —
  BFS, shallowest match wins, `node_modules`/`.git`/`dist`-style directories
  pruned, depth/size caps. `2026-06-10-tg-ctl-control-design.md` mentioned
  from the repo root now attaches from `docs/specs/`.

## 1.3.0

Never-attach denylist (`attach-denylist` feature, ON by default):

- Secret-looking files are never attached: the `.env` family, SSH private
  keys (`id_rsa`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.ppk`), credential
  rc-files (`.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.git-credentials`, `.pgpass`,
  `.my.cnf`, `.htpasswd`), shell/REPL histories, `*.tfvars`,
  `credentials.json` / `client_secret*.json`, `kubeconfig`.
- Auto-detected mentions in the text are silently skipped (the token stays);
  an explicit `--photo`/`--file` of a denylisted file is a hard ERROR before
  anything is sent.
- Conscious override: `--no-feature attach-denylist` or
  `features.attach-denylist: false` in `~/.config/tg-cli/config.yaml`.

## 1.2.0

Attachment quality pass:

- Markdown as PDF (`md-as-pdf` feature, ON by default): attached `.md` files
  are converted to PDF via pandoc + headless Chrome — emoji and Cyrillic
  render correctly. Any conversion failure attaches the original `.md`.
- UTF-8 BOM for text attachments: documents with non-ASCII UTF-8 content get
  a BOM prepended to the uploaded copy (disk file untouched), fixing
  Telegram's preview mojibake for Cyrillic. Scripts (`.sh`) and `.json` are
  deliberately excluded.
- Extensionless files (LICENSE, Makefile, `.env`) are no longer auto-attached;
  explicit `--photo`/`--file` still attach anything.
- Linear response cache: autolink-tasks verdicts (including verified-absent)
  are cached for 1 hour in `~/.cache/tg-cli/linear-cache.json` — repeated
  reports about the same tickets no longer spawn the `linear` CLI each send.

## 1.1.0

Autolink tasks (`autolink-tasks` feature, ON by default):

- Ticket-like codes in the message text (3 uppercase letters + dash + digits,
  e.g. `HYP-576`) are verified against Linear via the `linear` CLI and turned
  into links.
- A single mentioned ticket gets its title on the first line (after the
  emoji/[window] prefix when present); several tickets get a collapsed
  `<blockquote expandable>` reference block (`code: title`) at the end.
- Codes Linear doesn't know stay plain text. A missing `linear` CLI or missing
  auth produces a one-time stderr hint; the message is always sent unchanged
  on any autolink failure.
- Toggle with `--no-feature autolink-tasks` or
  `features.autolink-tasks: false` in `~/.config/tg-cli/config.yaml`.

## 1.0.0

CLI ergonomics pass:

- `-v` / `--version`: print version, the running git commit hash, and this
  changelog, then exit 0.
- Help anywhere: `-h`/`--help` (or no arguments at all) prints usage to stdout
  and exits 0 instead of sending an empty message.
- Auto-attach paths: existing file paths found in the message text are attached
  automatically (images as photos, everything else as documents) and excised
  from the caption.
- `OK` on success: a successful send prints `OK` to stdout.
- Unknown dashed flags are an error: a stray `--foo` prints help to stderr and
  exits non-zero instead of being sent as message text. All real flags
  (`--format`, `--photo`, `--file`, `--ls-emoji-helpers`, `--detect-model`) are
  still recognized — the unknown-flag check runs only after they are matched.
