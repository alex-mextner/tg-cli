# Changelog

All notable changes to `tg` are documented here. This project adheres to
semantic versioning.

## 1.18.1

`tg-ctl status` no longer lies about autostart when the daemon is supervised by an
EXTERNAL launchd job (tg-cli#88). It previously recognized only tg-ctl's own `enable`
unit (`com.agenttools.tg-ctl.tg-ctl`), so when launchd kept the daemon alive across
reboots via a separately-wired job (e.g. an `ai.hyperide.tg-ctl` LaunchAgent), status
printed `autostart: NOT enabled` while it actually autostarts on boot.

- **status probes launchd** (`launchctl list` + `launchctl print`) for any loaded job —
  other than tg-ctl's own unit — whose `ProgramArguments` runs THIS tg-ctl binary with the
  `run` subcommand, discovered by what the job RUNS (not a hardcoded label), and reports
  `autostart: enabled (via launchd: <label>)`. The own-`enable` mechanism is unchanged and
  takes precedence.
- Robust: non-macOS / launchctl-unavailable falls back to the existing logic and never
  crashes; root (uid 0) uses the `system` domain, not `gui/0`; binPath matching is
  basename-aware so a symlink-vs-realpath mismatch still resolves.

## 1.18.0

Forum-topics increment 4 — lifecycle polish (spec §9.4; tg-cli#86, refs #31/#85). Builds
on the increment-2 spawn executor with the deferred recovery + UX items:

- **Recent-repo path buttons** on the awaiting-path step (`tgp:<threadId>:<index>:<nonce>`):
  the prompt offers recent project cwds (routes store + per-pane registrations, newest-first,
  deduped to absolute existing dirs) as one-tap buttons, with a free-text fallback. A per-prompt
  nonce pins each button to its prompt, so a stale button from a superseded prompt is rejected
  rather than resolving its index against a newer choice list.
- **Model keyboard cleared on bind** (and on a restart-to-path) via `editMessageReplyMarkup`.
- **Re-spawn on a dead/closed pane:** a message to a topic whose pane died marks it `closed` and
  offers a one-tap *Re-spawn* button (`tgr:<threadId>`) that re-launches with the retained path +
  model — or restarts the `/new` flow when the path/model is missing or the dir vanished. The offer
  is throttled (one per dead topic), only stamped on a successful send, and a re-spawn failure
  restores `closed` so the next message re-offers.
- **Daemon auto-stamps `TG_TOPIC`** into the spawned window's env (`new-window -e TG_TOPIC=<id>`),
  so a topic agent's plain `tg "reply"` threads back into the topic without `--topic`.
- **Crash-window orphan reconcile** on startup re-binds a crash-orphaned agent to its topic instead
  of double-spawning, proven by a per-spawn token stored as a `@tg_spawn_token` window option
  (queryable via the pane format; `new-window -e` process env is not) plus a recorded-paneId
  fallback. Adoption requires same slug + same cwd + (token OR paneId), so a same-slug/cwd stranger
  is never adopted; a flaky startup snapshot is skipped (no mass-close); a model tap on a still-
  pending binding re-probes (just-in-time adoption) so a missed reconcile can't double-spawn.
- **Same-batch races handled:** a re-spawn tap + a text message in one batch routes the text to the
  re-bound pane (not dropped); a second same-batch message to a just-closed topic uses the throttled
  recovery, never the old "recreate the topic" dead-end.

All gated behind `control.topics` (default OFF → 1:1 byte-identical). Extensive tests in
`tests/ctl-topic-spawn-integration.test.ts`, `tests/ctl-topics.test.ts`, `tests/ctl-discover.test.ts`.

## 1.17.0

Forum-topics: spawn an agent on topic creation (the `/new` flow trigger, spec
increment 2; tg-cli#85, refs #27). When a Telegram forum topic is created the daemon
runs an interactive `/new` flow and launches a fresh agent bound to that topic — one
topic = one agent. The routing half (#56/#61) and the pure foundation already shipped;
this wires the `topic-new`/`topic-answer` entrypoint actions to a real `tmux new-window`
spawn plus a model-pick button.

- **Flow:** `forum_topic_created` → ask for a working directory → validate it
  (absolute + existing dir) → post model-catalog buttons → on a tap, spawn
  `tmux new-window -P -F '#{pane_id}' -- <model argv>` and bind the returned pane. The
  topic name is only the tmux-window slug; path + model come from the interactive flow.
- **Safety:** every spawn step is exception-guarded (a bad path / missing tmux / spawn
  error posts an error into the topic and never throws into the poll loop); no
  double-spawn (duplicate create filtered, already-bound refused, model validated once,
  sequential action dispatch); gated behind `control.topics` (default OFF → 1:1
  behaviour byte-identical).

## 1.16.0

Single-source the tool version (tg-cli#80). `tg --version` now reads the version
from `package.json` at runtime instead of a hardcoded `VERSION` literal, so the
two can no longer drift. The literal had already diverged (`1.15.0` in source vs
`1.0.0` in `package.json`); `package.json` is now the sole declaration and is the
field the ship version-bump gate tracks.

- **`package.json` is the single source of truth.** New `resolveVersion(scriptDir)`
  reads `package.json`'s `version` relative to the running script's directory (the
  tool runs directly via bun from the repo root, so `package.json` sits next to the
  `tg` entrypoint). `VERSION` is now sourced from it at module load rather than a
  literal; `versionOutput` resolves the version the same way. The runtime git-hash
  suffix is unchanged. A drift-guard test pins `tg --version`'s numeric part to
  `package.json`'s `version` so they can never diverge again.

## 1.15.0

Two `tg-ctl` routing/picker fixes (tg-cli#75): no-reply auto-bind to the
most-recently-active agent, and `/agent` picker labels by the real tmux window
name instead of the cwd basename.

- **No-reply auto-bind to the last-active agent.** A plain (non-reply) message to
  a multi-agent fleet used to fall to `ambiguous target — candidates: …`. It now
  binds to the **most-recently-active agent** — the pane whose last outbound `tg`
  send is newest (the same `aggregateUsage` LRU/MRU signal the reply picker ranks
  by). A recognized reply route still wins first; the auto-bind only resolves an
  otherwise-ambiguous non-reply; and with no activity history or a tie at the
  most-recent timestamp it stays ambiguous so the button picker still fires (the
  unscoped fail-closed). New pure `resolveAmbiguousByActivity`
  (`features/tg-ctl/discover.ts`).
- **`/agent` picker uses the tmux WINDOW NAME, not the cwd.** The picker labelled
  agents by the cwd basename ("hyperide · claude") instead of the user-set window
  name ("ext"). Root cause: window names were fetched in a SEPARATE `tmux
  list-panes` call that skipped the UTF-8 locale env, so under launchd the
  tab-mangle blanked every name and the label fell back to the cwd. `#{window_name}`
  is now a fixed field in the core, locale-safe `PANE_FORMAT` (`PaneInfo.windowName`,
  carried through `parsePaneList`). A bare default — a number, a shell/launcher
  command (`zsh`/`node`), or a cc version string (`2.1.181`) — is treated as
  non-distinguishing and the label leans on the cwd project dir.

## 1.14.0

Help-UX cleanup: deduped usage, standard topic-help, and a configured-vs-pending
status glyph on `tg voice setup` (ROADMAP "tg help specifics").

- **Usage block no longer repeats `[--format plain|html]` on every line.**
  `--format` is a global modifier shown ONCE in `Options:`; the usage examples
  now read cleanly (`tg "text"`, `tg --photo … "caption"`, …) with a one-line
  note that the global options apply to any form.
- **`tg help format` is the canonical formatting reference** — the standard
  topic-help convention (`tg help <topic>`), advertised in the main `tg --help`.
  `tg help` with no topic prints the main help; an unknown topic
  (`tg help bogus`) errors with a 3-part message and a non-zero exit. The old
  `--format-help` flag is kept as a back-compat alias (byte-identical output).
- **`tg voice setup` shows actual STATUS** — a green `✓` when voice transcription
  is configured, a yellow `○` when it is still pending (the install-* state
  principle). The glyph is plain unicode so it is meaningful on BOTH surfaces:
  colorized for the terminal, and ANSI-free in the Telegram onboarding reply.

## 1.13.0

`tg#<id>` message-ref convention + GitHub-anchor line specs.

- **Inbound wrap renders the message id as `tg#<id>`** (was bare `#<id>`):
  `[TG from Alex tg#1234] …`. The `tg#` prefix is what lets the outbound
  autolink layer tell a Telegram-message reference apart from a GitHub
  issue/PR `#<id>` so a quoted-back `tg#3715` is never mis-resolved as #3715.
- **New `autolink-msgrefs` feature** (ON by default). Links `tg#<id>` refs in
  outbound text: a `t.me/c/` deep link in a supergroup chat, a marked-but-
  unlinked styled reference in a private DM (no public per-message URL exists).
  Runs BEFORE the `#N` PR pass. Toggle with `--no-feature autolink-msgrefs`.
- **File line-specs now accept the GitHub permalink-anchor forms** `file#L10`,
  `file#L10-L20`, and `file#L10-20` (the second endpoint's `L` is optional),
  alongside the existing `file:N` / `:N-M` / `:N:C`. A pasted GitHub line link
  gets the same inline excerpt + marker-injected attachment.

## 1.12.0

`--tag` is now LOWERCASE-ENGLISH ONLY, and `--help` is colorized to match the
rest of the agent-CLI ecosystem (review / rig / draw).

- **`--tag` accepts only `answer` / `decision` / `problem` / `report`** (the
  lowercase-english tag words). Russian aliases (`ОТВЕТ`/`РЕШЕНИЕ`/`ПРОБЛЕМА`/
  `ОТЧЁТ`) and uppercase / mixed-case / unknown values are now **rejected** at
  parse time with a 3-part error and a non-zero exit, instead of the old
  soft-render-and-warn:

  ```
  invalid --tag 'ANSWER': tags must be lowercase english.
  Use one of: answer, decision, problem, report
  ```

  The `answer` tag still requires `--reply-to`. Validation lives in
  `validateTag` (`features/render/tag.ts`) and runs in `parseArgs`, so every
  send path fails before touching Telegram.
- **Colorized help.** `tg --help` and `tg --format-help` now colorize section
  headers (bold cyan) and option names (green), matching review/rig/draw. Color
  is dependency-free ANSI, auto-disabled when stdout is not a TTY or `NO_COLOR`
  is set, so piped/redirected help stays plain.

## 1.11.0

`tg replies` — recall what was sent over Telegram, so an agent can quickly
remember what the user asked without scrolling its own pane.

- **New subcommand `tg replies [user|agent|all] [list | find <query>]`.**
  - Direction (1st positional, default `user`): `user` = inbound messages the
    user sent, `agent` = outbound messages the agent sent via `tg`, `all` = both
    (prefixed `←` user / `→` agent).
  - Action (2nd positional, default `list`): `list` shows recent messages
    oldest→newest; `find <query>` is a case-insensitive substring search
    (`--regex` for a regular expression).
  - Line format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] #<id> <text>` (local time, Telegram
    message id). Long text truncates to ~200 chars unless `--full`.
  - **Default scope = the current tmux session/pane.** The pane is detected from
    `$TMUX_PANE`; `--all-sessions` drops the scope, `--session <paneId>` targets
    a specific pane. `-n/--limit N` (default 20), `--json` (machine-readable
    array: ts ms, id, direction, from, text, pane), and `--help` round it out.
- **Append-only history log.** A new `tg-ctl.<botid>.history.jsonl` (next to the
  daemon's `routes` map, under `~/.config/tg-cli`) records one JSON object per
  line: `{ts, message_id, direction, from, text, pane}`. The `tg-ctl` daemon
  writes inbound messages (stamped with the routed pane); `tg` writes outbound
  messages (stamped with `$TMUX_PANE`). Both writers are best-effort — a corrupt
  or unwritable log never breaks a send or an inject — and the file is trimmed to
  its last ~5000 lines on write.
- Pure logic (`features/replies/`: arg parsing, JSONL parse/append/trim,
  direction + pane filters, substring/regex search, line + JSON formatters)
  stays out of the effectful entrypoints, mirroring the `tg-ctl` module split.

## 1.10.1

Inbound media downloads no longer drop a message on a transient network blip.

- **Retry-with-backoff on inbound media download (`tg-ctl`).** The control
  daemon's `downloadFileToCache` did a single `getFile` fetch and a single
  file-bytes fetch; ANY transient failure on either — a dropped connection, a
  5xx, a timeout — logged "media download failed", returned null, and (because
  the poll offset was already persisted) silently lost the inbound voice note /
  photo / doc forever. Both network steps now run under a bounded
  retry-with-backoff (`features/tg-ctl/retry.ts`): 3 attempts with jittered
  exponential backoff (~300ms → 900ms → 2.7s), retrying on a thrown network
  error / abort / timeout or a non-2xx HTTP response. A permanent Telegram-level
  error (HTTP 200 with `{ok:false}`) is left alone, not retried. The success
  path and the caller contract are unchanged — it still returns the cached path
  or null — and each retry plus the final give-up is logged with the step name
  and attempt count.

## 1.10.0

Native Telegram **Rich Messages** (tables, headings, lists, LaTeX formulas),
folded into the EXISTING `--format html` path — no new flag, no new `--format`
value.

- **Rich messages via `--format html` (auto-routed).** Bot API 10.1 (June 2026)
  added `sendRichMessage`, which renders a much larger HTML tag set than the
  basic `parse_mode=HTML` path: native bordered tables (`<table>`/`<tr>`/`<td>`
  with `align`/`valign`/`colspan`/`rowspan`/`<caption>`), headings (`<h1>`..
  `<h6>`), lists (`<ul>`/`<ol>`/`<li>`), dividers (`<hr>`), paragraphs (`<p>`),
  collapsible `<details>`, pull quotes (`<aside>`), footers, and LaTeX formulas
  (`<tg-math>` inline / `<tg-math-block>` block). `tg` now decides by CONTENT:
  HTML using only the basic inline tags (b/i/u/s/code/pre/a/blockquote/tg-emoji/
  tg-time/spoiler) sends as before (`sendMessage`); HTML containing any rich-only
  tag auto-sends a Rich Message (`sendRichMessage` with `rich_message.html`).
  ONE flag (`--format html`); the tool routes on what's inside.
- A rich body is sent **whole** — never 4096-split (splitting a `<table>` would
  corrupt it; rich has a 32768-char budget) and never used as a media caption.
- `--tag` / `--title` / `--reply-to` compose with rich messages: the branded
  header line (custom-emoji tag pill + styled title — all basic tags valid inside
  a rich body) sits above the rich content; threading uses `reply_parameters`
  (sendRichMessage has no `reply_to_message_id` field).
- **Rich limits pre-flighted locally** (≤ 32768 chars, ≤ 500 blocks, ≤ 16
  nesting levels, ≤ 50 media, ≤ 20 table columns) so an oversize body fails with
  a clear `tg:` error instead of an opaque API 400.
- **`tg --format-help` corrected.** It no longer claims "Telegram has NO tables".
  It now documents the BASIC vs RICH tiers, the rich tag set, a `<table>`
  example, and the rich limits. The monospace `tg --table` (`<pre>`) stays as the
  plain fallback grid.

## 1.9.7

Tag-badge notification clarity.

- **Tag pill fallback dots are now `[color, neutral, neutral]`.** Each `--tag`
  badge (ANSWER/DECISION/PROBLEM/REPORT) is a wordmark pill made of N custom-emoji
  CELLS. In a push notification — rendered by the OS, which can't load the
  custom-emoji image — each cell shows its fallback dot in place of the image.
  Previously every cell fell back to the SAME color dot, so the badge appeared as
  `🔵🔵🔵` (three loud identical dots). Now only the FIRST cell keeps the tag's
  colored dot and the rest fall back to a neutral white square (`▫️`), so the
  badge appears as `🔵▫️▫️`: one colored dot tells you WHICH tag by color (🔵
  answer / 🟠 decision / 🔴 problem / 🟢 report), the rest stay quiet. (The tag
  WORD is not part of the badge — the HTML header carries only the pill cells; any
  text after the dots in a notification is the `--title`/body, not the tag word.)
  The in-app pill IMAGE is unchanged (premium clients still see the full
  wordmark); only the per-cell fallback alt changes. The live sticker-set alts
  were synced to match (`scripts/sync-tag-pill-alts.ts`), so the rendered
  `<tg-emoji>` inner text still equals each cell's Telegram-side alt (required or
  Telegram drops the entity).

## 1.9.6

Three formatting/reply additions.

- **Threaded replies (`--reply-to <message_id>`).** Pass an inbound Telegram
  `message_id` and the outbound message threads UNDER it (`reply_to_message_id`
  on `sendMessage`), so an answer visibly attaches to the message it answers.
  Only the FIRST message of a >4096 split is threaded. The `tg-ctl` daemon now
  surfaces the inbound id in the injected wrap — `[TG from Alex #1234] …` — so
  the agent reading its pane knows the id to reply to. The id IS Telegram's own
  per-chat sequential `message_id` (no parallel id scheme invented). The
  **ANSWER / ОТВЕТ** tag now REQUIRES `--reply-to` (answering means answering a
  specific message); a clear error fires if it is missing. The other tags are
  unchanged.
- **`tg --table`.** Reads delimited rows from STDIN (TSV, or `a | b` per line),
  auto-sizes columns, draws box borders, HTML-escapes cells, and sends an
  aligned monospace table wrapped in `<pre>` — Telegram has no native HTML
  tables, a padded `<pre>` is the only way. Composes with `--tag`/`--title`;
  argv text becomes a heading above the table. Cells with double-width glyphs
  (emoji/CJK) trigger a one-line alignment warning but still send.
- **`tg --format-help`.** Prints a concise, copy-pasteable reference for what
  Telegram message formatting actually supports (the HTML-tag allowlist, the
  four HTML entities, the `<pre>` table pattern, the `--tag`/`--title` badge) so
  agents stop guessing. Referenced from `tg --help`.

## 1.9.5

- **Voice transcripts now inject as a 🎤-marked quote.** An inbound voice note's
  transcription is wrapped `🎤 «…»` (mirroring the `↩ «…»` reply anchor) before it
  reaches the agent pane, so the agent — and a human glancing at the pane — can tell
  it is machine-transcribed speech (which may carry recognition errors), not text
  typed verbatim. Both the reply and standalone routes apply it.

## 1.9.4

Inbound voice messages → text (local Whisper STT). Talk instead of type.

- **A Telegram VOICE note now becomes agent input.** When you send a voice note
  to the bot, the `tg-ctl` daemon downloads the OGG/OPUS, transcodes it to WAV
  16 kHz mono with `ffmpeg`, runs a local Whisper, cleans the transcript, and
  injects the resulting text into the SAME agent pane a typed message would
  reach — reusing the existing reply-routing (a voice note sent as a reply
  carries the same quote anchor and routes to the replied-to origin pane). Audio
  notes take the same path. Transcription runs through an ASYNC (non-blocking)
  spawn, so the daemon's poll loop and q→buttons hook server stay responsive
  while Whisper works.
- **Whisper is discovered, not bundled.** `tg voice setup` (or the auto-prompt
  on the first unconfigured voice note) probes the host — `~/xp/whisper.cpp`
  first, then conventional clone locations and `PATH` — finds the built
  `whisper-cli` binary and a real `ggml-*.bin` model (preferring multilingual
  large/medium over English-only over the test fixtures), checks for `ffmpeg`,
  and persists the runner/binary/model/language into `config.yaml`. faster-whisper
  (an import-verified project `.venv`) is supported as a fallback runner.
- **First-use onboarding, never a silent drop.** A voice note that arrives before
  Whisper is configured triggers a guided reply: it points at an existing `~/xp`
  install when present, or tells you to build whisper.cpp + download a model (or
  install `ffmpeg`), then run `tg voice setup`. Once a working install is found
  on the fly it is persisted so the next note transcribes without re-prompting.
  Download / transcribe / persist failures are caught and reported — a note is
  never lost after the at-most-once offset advances.
- **Config:** a new top-level `voice:` block in `~/.config/tg-cli/config.yaml`
  (`enabled`, `runner`, `bin_path`, `model_path`, `language` — default language
  `auto`, covering ru + en). No secrets are written — only binary/model paths.
  Reloaded per note, so `tg voice setup` takes effect without a daemon restart;
  an explicit `enabled: false` is honored as the opt-out.

## 1.9.3

Cleaner tag header + emoji tooling reads its bot token from config.

- **No more duplicate tag word on the header line.** A `--tag` with real pill ids
  now renders ONLY the wordmark pill cells in the HTML header — the appended
  plain tag word (e.g. a second "ANSWER" next to the pill) is gone. The wordmark
  is already baked into the sticker art, so the duplicate was redundant and (when
  combined with `--title`) clashed with the styled title. The first line is now
  the `--title` text (styled) only; the tag is just the pill badge. Non-premium
  viewers fall back to the per-cell colored dots — an accepted trade for a clean
  premium first line. The `plain` form (non-HTML / >4096 split) keeps the
  readable unicode fallback (`🔵 ANSWER`). Unknown tags still soft-render as
  `[WORD]`. (`features/render/prefix.ts`.)
- **Emoji-set scripts read their bot token from config, decoupled from the
  sender.** `scripts/create-tag-emoji.ts` and `scripts/create-ai-emoji-set.ts`
  now read `TG_EMOJI_BOT_TOKEN` (the dedicated emoji-owning bot) from
  `~/.config/tg-cli/.env`, falling back to `TG_BOT_TOKEN` only when unset; owner
  id is `TG_OWNER_ID` then `TG_CHAT_ID`. They use the shared config loader
  (`features/config/env.ts`, extracted from the `tg` entrypoint) so the config
  `.env` → process.env precedence applies and a token set only in config works
  with no transient shell export. The token is never printed.
  (`features/config/env.ts`, `scripts/create-tag-emoji.ts`,
  `scripts/create-ai-emoji-set.ts`, `tg`.)

## 1.9.2

Code/config files → mobile, syntax-highlighted PDF (and by default ONLY the PDF
is sent).

- **`code-as-pdf` feature (ON by default).** Attaching a code/config file —
  `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.json`, `.jsonc`, `.yaml`,
  `.yml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.rb`, `.php`, `.java`, `.kt`,
  `.swift`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.cs`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.sql`, `.css`,
  `.scss`, `.less`, `.html`, `.xml`, `.svg`, `.graphql`, `.proto`, `.lua`, `.r`,
  `.dart`, `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, … (full map in
  `features/code-pdf/convert.ts`) — is rendered to a **mobile-sized,
  syntax-highlighted, soft-wrapped PDF** before sending. Telegram's iOS client
  previews raw source uselessly; the PDF is the readable artifact on a phone.
  Pipeline reuses the md-pdf machinery: fence the content in the detected
  language → pandoc (skylighting highlighting) → headless Chrome
  `--print-to-pdf` at the phone page size. Long lines **soft-wrap** (CSS
  `white-space: pre-wrap` + `overflow-wrap: anywhere`) so there is NO horizontal
  scroll. Monospace, light theme (`tango`), optional line numbers.
- **BY DEFAULT only the PDF is sent — the raw file is NOT attached.** On iOS the
  raw `.ts` is noise; the PDF is what you actually read. Two flags adjust:
    - **`--with-original`** — also attach the raw file alongside the PDF.
    - **`--no-pdf`** — skip the render and attach the raw file (the prior
      behavior). Equivalent to `--no-feature code-as-pdf`.
- **`--pdf-device <name>`** (or `TG_PDF_DEVICE`) — page geometry preset:
  `iphone15pro` (default, 393pt wide), `iphone15promax`, `iphonese`, `a4`.
  `TG_PDF_THEME` overrides the pandoc highlight style (default `tango`).
- Markdown keeps its own `.md`→PDF path (`detectCodeLang` returns null for it);
  images / `.pdf` / other documents are untouched. On any render failure the raw
  file is attached unchanged (same fail-open policy as md-as-pdf).
  (`features/code-pdf/convert.ts`, `features/cli/args.ts`,
  `features/auto-attach/feature-flags.ts`, `tg`.)

## 1.9.1

Wider tag pills, hosted under @hyperidebot.

- **ANSWER and REPORT widened to 3 cells.** 1.9.0 sliced the two 6-letter
  wordmarks into 2 cells each, so the rounded caps squished the text. Both now
  use 3 cells (matching DECISION / PROBLEM), giving the wordmark breathing room.
  The generator (`scripts/build-tag-pills.py`) sets all four canonical tags to 3
  cells; the upload script and render path follow.
- **Pill set re-created under @hyperidebot.** The custom-emoji set moved from
  `replytags_by_UltraClaudeCodeBot` to
  [`replytags_by_hyperidebot`](https://t.me/addemoji/replytags_by_hyperidebot)
  (12 cells, 3 per tag). The sending bot does NOT need to own the set — it can
  reference a set owned by a different bot (verified live). The old set was
  deleted.

## 1.9.0

Custom-emoji tag pills go live.

- **`--tag` now renders a real custom-emoji wordmark PILL.** 1.8.0 shipped the
  `--tag` plumbing with PLACEHOLDER pill ids, so every tag fell back to the
  unicode badge (`🔵 ANSWER`). This release uploads the pill sticker set
  (`replytags_by_UltraClaudeCodeBot`, https://t.me/addemoji/replytags_by_UltraClaudeCodeBot)
  and wires the real `custom_emoji_id`s into `TAG_PILL_IDS`. Premium clients now
  see the wordmark chip; everyone else sees the unicode fallback. The four pills
  (🔵 ANSWER / 🟠 DECISION / 🔴 PROBLEM / 🟢 REPORT) are sliced into 2–3 cells
  each. (`features/branding/emoji.ts`, `scripts/create-tag-emoji.ts`.)
- **Fix: pill cells wrap a single emoji, not a slice of the word.** Telegram
  rejects a `custom_emoji` entity whose fallback text is not exactly one emoji
  with `ENTITY_TEXT_INVALID`. The renderer now emits one `<tg-emoji>` per cell
  wrapping the canonical dot (`🔵`), and appends the readable WORD as plain text
  after the cells (`<pill cells> ANSWER`) so the label is never lost — premium
  clients see the pill image + word, non-premium see `🔵🔵 ANSWER`. The dead
  `splitForCells` word-distributor (the discarded slice approach) is removed.
  (`features/render/prefix.ts`.)

## 1.8.0

Header tag/title; revert the body-pull from 1.7.1.

- **The message body is no longer pulled onto the `✳️ [window]` header line.**
  1.7.1 joined the body's first line onto the header (the prefix ended with a
  space instead of a newline). That was a mistake: the message text must NOT be
  pulled up. `buildPrefix` now ends the header with a newline again, so the body
  always sits BELOW `✳️ [window]` (the pre-1.7.1 behavior). The single-ticket
  autolink title still renders on the header line (it is a ticket title, not
  message text), and the 1.7.1 reply-routing fix is untouched.
  (`features/render/prefix.ts`, `features/autolink-tasks/render.ts`, `tg`.)
- **`--title <text>`** — set an explicit header title: `✳️ [window] <title>`.
  ONLY an explicit `--title` ever appears there; the message body is never
  pulled up. No `--title` → the header is just `✳️ [window]` with the body
  below. The title is styled Bold Italic (a Cyrillic title falls back to `<i>`).
- **`--tag <TAG>`** — an emoji badge labeling what the message is. Canonical
  tags are Russian and case-insensitive; English aliases map to them:
  ОТВЕТ/ANSWER (🔵 💬), РЕШЕНИЕ/DECISION (🟠 ⚖️), ПРОБЛЕМА/PROBLEM (🔴 🚨),
  ОТЧЁТ/REPORT (🟢 📋). It composes with `--title`:
  `✳️ [window] 🔵 💬 ОТВЕТ — <title>`. An unknown tag soft-renders as a plain
  `[TAG]` badge plus a one-line stderr note (it never blocks a send). The
  default emoji mapping lives in one editable constant (`TAG_EMOJI` in
  `features/render/tag.ts`).
- **Skill advertising** — `tg install-skill` now documents `--tag`/`--title`,
  the four canonical tags, their English aliases, and their meanings in both the
  generated `SKILL.md` and the always-on blurb, so agents discover the
  convention from the skill itself.

## 1.7.1

Reply-routing + message-header fixes.

- **Reply routing no longer always opens the picker** — replying in Telegram to a
  message an agent sent now routes straight to that agent's pane. `tg` recorded
  the route's project identity as `process.cwd()`, but agents run `tg` from
  `/tmp`, so it never matched the daemon's check against the pane's
  `pane_current_path` and every reply fell through to the "choose an agent"
  picker. `tg` now records the origin pane's `pane_current_path` at send time, so
  send-time and reply-time compare the same quantity. The pane-id-reuse guard
  (a reply can't leak into a different project that reused the pane) is preserved.
  (`recordRoute` in `tg`, `resolveRouteCwd` / `routeMatchesPane` in
  `features/tg-ctl/routes.ts`.)
- **Task title / message body on the same line as `[window]`** — the agent
  header rendered `✳️ [window]` and dropped the task title / message text to line
  2. The prefix now joins the body with a space, so it reads
  `✳️ [window] 𝑻𝒂𝒔𝒌 𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒍𝒆` on one line. (`buildPrefix` in
  `features/render/prefix.ts`.)

## 1.7.0

Pre-send-photo hook framework + `review --visual` unstyled guard.

- **Pre-send-photo hook point** — `tg` now runs an extensible hook chain
  (`agents-hooks/v1`) over every outgoing `--photo` before it leaves. Drop a
  descriptor under `~/.agents/hooks/tg/<id>.pre-send-photo.json` (an executable
  with a priority / timeout / on-error policy) and it runs against the PNG; a
  hook can `allow` the send or `block` it with the canonical exit code 10.
  (`features/hooks/`, `tg hooks list|trust`.)
- **`review --visual` unstyled guard** — the bundled `review-visual` descriptor
  pipes the outgoing photo through `review --visual <png> --json --strict` and
  blocks an unstyled / broken / blank render before it ships. Vision is slow, so
  the hook runs with a 60s timeout and `on_error: open`: a slow or unavailable
  vision call NEVER blocks a send — only an explicit rollback verdict does.
  (`review install-hook tg` substitutes the absolute cmd path.)
- **Trust by default** — drop-in descriptors LOAD AND RUN with no `tg hooks
  trust` ceremony on the user's own machine. The legacy TOFU quarantine + SHA
  pin re-engages only under `AGENTS_HOOKS_TRUST=1` (the rare untrusted-input
  case); `AGENTS_HOOKS_TRUST=auto` runs under the guard but auto-trusts.
- **Fail-open, non-breaking** — no descriptors dir ⇒ a single `stat` and a
  byte-identical send (zero behavior change for existing users). A hook crash,
  timeout, or malformed output warns and sends anyway; only exit-10 blocks.
  Every run is recorded to an append-only `audit.jsonl`.

## 1.6.1

- **Task-title styling restyled** — the single-ticket autolink task title now
  renders in **Mathematical Bold Italic** (`𝑭𝒊𝒙`) instead of the gaudier Bold
  Script (`𝓕𝓲𝔁`). The whole-token `<i>` fallback for Cyrillic / foreign-letter
  titles (which the math block can't represent) is unchanged.
  (`features/prefix-style/`, docs/specs/unicode-prefix-styling.md.)

## 1.6.0

Agent addressing, reply quotes, prefix styling, and compound autolinks.

- **`/agent [<window>] <message>`** — address a specific agent when several run
  at once. The window is fuzzy-matched with phonetic normalization (Cyrillic→
  Latin, sound-folding), a confident match routes the message straight to that
  pane, and an ambiguous / unspecified target shows session-grouped inline
  selection buttons. Bare `/agent` lists the addressable agents.
  (`features/tg-ctl/agent-match.ts`, docs/specs/agent-addressing.md.)
- **Reply quotes + routing** — replying to a message forwards a quote anchor
  into the agent: `↩ «[date time] <quote>…»` (partial Telegram selection wins,
  else the start of the replied-to message). A reply to a **recognized** message
  routes to the pane that produced it (message_id→pane routes map written by
  `tg`); an **unrecognized** reply shows the window picker ordered by **LRU+MRU**.
  (docs/specs/reply-quotes.md.)
- **q→buttons, now seamless** — `tg-ctl install-hooks` idempotently wires the
  Claude Code agent-question/permission hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`
  (backup first; existing hooks preserved); `tg-ctl ask` normalizes the raw
  harness payload so the hook is trivial; `tg-ctl status` reports whether it is
  installed. While an agent is blocked on a question, new inbound messages to it
  are **deferred** (queued, marked ✍️) and flushed when the question is answered.
  (docs/q-buttons-prerequisites.md.)
- **Unicode prefix styling** — the tmux window name in `[]` renders in
  Mathematical Sans-Serif Bold and a single-ticket task title in Bold Script,
  with a `<b>`/`<i>` fallback for Cyrillic names the math blocks can't represent.
  (`features/prefix-style/`, docs/specs/unicode-prefix-styling.md.)
- **Compound autolinks** — one token may carry a range or list of refs
  (`HYP-100..103/110`, `#5-7,9`): the body links only the written numbers
  (range endpoints), and the bottom reference block enumerates the full range.
  (`features/autolink-refs/`, docs/specs/autolink-compound.md.)
- Documented the q→buttons prerequisites and the missing hook installer
  (docs/q-buttons-prerequisites.md), and a WhatsApp companion-transport
  implementation spec (docs/specs/whatsapp-transport.md, spec only).

## 1.5.1

Agent detection fix (outbound branding):

- `tg` now identifies a `codex` (and `aider`/`pi`/`opencode`) session by walking
  its own ancestor process tree, not just an env marker. Codex exports no env
  signal for the shell commands it spawns (`CODEX` unset, `CODEX_HOME` empty),
  so detection used to fall through to the `pgrep` fallbacks where a background
  `ollama` daemon (common on macOS) won — mislabeling codex reports as `ollama`.
  The ancestry walk runs before the `pgrep` block, so the launching agent wins
  and a sibling daemon can no longer hijack the label. Mirrors `tg-ctl`'s
  inbound `findAgentInPane` (new `findAgentInAncestry`, shared `matchAgentCommand`).

## 1.5.0

Q→buttons (`tg-ctl`, spec §8 core path):

- New `tg-ctl ask` hook client: reads a normalized question / permission JSON
  request, hands it to the running daemon over a bot-scoped Unix socket
  (`tg-ctl.<botid>.sock`), sends Telegram inline buttons, consumes
  `callback_query` updates in the same poll stream, immediately
  `answerCallbackQuery`s every tap, edits expired/answered prompts, enforces
  the active registration guard (`paneId`/`cwd`/`sessionName`), and returns
  agent-specific hook output. A missing daemon/socket, timeout, or send
  failure returns no decision so the local agent UI takes over.
- Claude Code question and permission shapes are supported; Codex
  `PermissionRequest` emits the documented
  `hookEventName: "PermissionRequest"` decision shape; opencode
  `question.asked` / `question.v2.asked` / `permission.asked` /
  `permission.v2.asked` adapter helpers map to the matching native reply
  endpoints; `pi` is detected but reports native Q→buttons as unsupported.
- Hardening (post-review): the hook socket is `chmod 0600` on listen and
  caps requests at 64 KiB; taps are validated against the prompt's own
  Telegram `message_id` (a stale tap on an earlier message that reused the
  callback key answers "expired"); the registration guard treats `paneId` as
  authoritative — a pane mismatch fast-passes even when `cwd`/`sessionName`
  agree, so a second keyboard session in the same cwd never blocks on
  Telegram.
- Deferred (recorded in the spec): hook installer/canary automation,
  long-running opencode SSE ownership.

## 1.4.0

Inbound control v1 (`tg-ctl`, spec §16 — poll/tmux transport, ON by default;
opt out with `control.enabled: false`):

- New `tg-ctl` entrypoint at the repo root: `start` / `run` / `stop` / `status`.
  A singleton daemon long-polls Telegram `getUpdates` and injects inbound
  messages into the target agent's tmux pane, wrapped as
  `[TG from {name}] {msg} — reply via tg`. Outbound stays `tg`-only.
- Hard singleton via real `flock(2)` (`bun:ffi` → libSystem/libc): the launcher
  spawns the daemon detached and never takes the lock; the daemon flocks as its
  first action and exits 0 if another instance holds it.
- Lazy auto-start: a successful `tg` send from a tmux pane with a detected
  agent fire-and-forgets `tg-ctl start`, handing over the `TMUX_PANE`/cwd
  registration snapshot (gated on `control.enabled`).
- Pane-id targeting with pre-inject verification: the agent process is located
  by walking the pane's process tree (a Claude Code pane reports its version
  string, not `claude`, as the pane command); injection refuses + replies in
  Telegram if the pane no longer hosts an agent — text never lands in a shell.
- Commands: `/stop` (Escape inject — interrupts the turn, session survives),
  `/kill` (SIGINT + "restore via `claude --resume`"), `/status`; any other
  `/cmd` passes through verbatim; plain text is a wrapped prompt.
- Photo/document inbound: `getFile` download (≤20 MB) to
  `~/.cache/tg-cli/inbound/`, the local path is injected for the agent to read.
- Safety/robustness: sender-id allowlist, at-most-once offset persistence,
  staleness window (default 300 s) with a "skipped N stale" notice, 409
  backoff with a one-shot warning, idle TTL (default 30 min), multi-line
  injection via bracketed paste.
- Delivery receipts: a successfully handled inbound message gets a 👀
  reaction; every failure answers with an error reply instead.
- Config: new `control:` block (`enabled`, `transport`, `session`,
  `inject_wrap`, `staleness_sec`, `idle_exit_min`, `allowed_senders`).
  One bot token per machine for inbound (Telegram allows a single `getUpdates`
  consumer); outbound `tg` is unaffected.
- Deferred (recorded in the spec): question/permission forwarding with inline
  buttons (v1.1), opencode native adapter (v1.1), `/rename`+`/new` (v1.2),
  channel mode (v1.2+), configurable Escape prelude.

Also in this release:

- New `autolink-prs` feature (ON by default): GitHub `#N` references in the
  message text are resolved against the cwd repo via `gh` (one `gh repo view`
  for identity + one batched `gh api graphql` with aliased `issueOrPullRequest`
  fields) and linkified. Resolved ISSUES merge into the existing
  `autolink-tasks` reference block (`#N — Title`); PULL REQUESTS get their own
  collapsed `PRs:` block at the END of the message with a state annotation
  (`(merged)`/`(closed)`/`(draft)`/`(open)`). Verdicts (positive and negative)
  are cached 1 h in `~/.cache/tg-cli/gh-cache.json`, keyed by `owner/repo#N` so
  the same `#260` in different repos never collides. Every failure mode (no
  `gh`, not authenticated, non-GitHub cwd, partial/missing numbers) keeps the
  send going as plain text; missing-CLI / not-authenticated emit a one-time
  stderr hint reusing the `autolink-tasks` hint-state file. Disable with
  `--no-feature autolink-prs`.
- New `recursive-attach` feature (ON by default): a file mentioned by bare
  name or path suffix that misses plain and worktree-root resolution is now
  found recursively under the worktree roots (or cwd outside a git repo) —
  BFS, shallowest match wins, `node_modules`/`.git`/`dist`-style directories
  pruned, depth/size caps. `2026-06-10-tg-ctl-control-design.md` mentioned
  from the repo root now attaches from `docs/specs/`.
- `autolink-tasks` now retries one unexpected `linear api` failure before
  degrading to plain text, so transient Linear CLI/API failures do not silently
  drop ticket links.

## 1.3.0

Never-attach denylist (`attach-denylist` feature, ON by default):

- Secret-looking files are never attached: the `.env` family, SSH private
  keys (`id_rsa`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.ppk`), credential
  rc-files (`.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.git-credentials`, `.pgpass`,
  `.my.cnf`, `.htpasswd`), shell/REPL histories, `*.tfvars`,
  `credentials.json` / `client_secret*.json`, `kubeconfig`.
- Auto-detected mentions in the text are silently skipped (the token stays);
  an explicit `--photo`/`--file` of a denylisted file is a hard ERROR before
  anything is sent.
- Conscious override: `--no-feature attach-denylist` or
  `features.attach-denylist: false` in `~/.config/tg-cli/config.yaml`.

## 1.2.0

Attachment quality pass:

- Markdown as PDF (`md-as-pdf` feature, ON by default): attached `.md` files
  are converted to PDF via pandoc + headless Chrome — emoji and Cyrillic
  render correctly. Any conversion failure attaches the original `.md`.
- UTF-8 BOM for text attachments: documents with non-ASCII UTF-8 content get
  a BOM prepended to the uploaded copy (disk file untouched), fixing
  Telegram's preview mojibake for Cyrillic. Scripts (`.sh`) and `.json` are
  deliberately excluded.
- Extensionless files (LICENSE, Makefile, `.env`) are no longer auto-attached;
  explicit `--photo`/`--file` still attach anything.
- Linear response cache: autolink-tasks verdicts (including verified-absent)
  are cached for 1 hour in `~/.cache/tg-cli/linear-cache.json` — repeated
  reports about the same tickets no longer spawn the `linear` CLI each send.

## 1.1.0

Autolink tasks (`autolink-tasks` feature, ON by default):

- Ticket-like codes in the message text (3 uppercase letters + dash + digits,
  e.g. `HYP-576`) are verified against Linear via the `linear` CLI and turned
  into links.
- A single mentioned ticket gets its title on the first line (after the
  emoji/[window] prefix when present); several tickets get a collapsed
  `<blockquote expandable>` reference block (`code: title`) at the end.
- Codes Linear doesn't know stay plain text. A missing `linear` CLI or missing
  auth produces a one-time stderr hint; the message is always sent unchanged
  on any autolink failure.
- Toggle with `--no-feature autolink-tasks` or
  `features.autolink-tasks: false` in `~/.config/tg-cli/config.yaml`.

## 1.0.0

CLI ergonomics pass:

- `-v` / `--version`: print version, the running git commit hash, and this
  changelog, then exit 0.
- Help anywhere: `-h`/`--help` (or no arguments at all) prints usage to stdout
  and exits 0 instead of sending an empty message.
- Auto-attach paths: existing file paths found in the message text are attached
  automatically (images as photos, everything else as documents) and excised
  from the caption.
- `OK` on success: a successful send prints `OK` to stdout.
- Unknown dashed flags are an error: a stray `--foo` prints help to stderr and
  exits non-zero instead of being sent as message text. All real flags
  (`--format`, `--photo`, `--file`, `--ls-emoji-helpers`, `--detect-model`) are
  still recognized — the unknown-flag check runs only after they are matched.
