# Changelog

All notable changes to `tg` are documented here. This project adheres to
semantic versioning.

## 1.1.0

Autolink tasks (`autolink-tasks` feature, ON by default):

- Ticket-like codes in the message text (3 uppercase letters + dash + digits,
  e.g. `HYP-576`) are verified against Linear via the `linear` CLI and turned
  into links.
- A single mentioned ticket gets its title on the first line (after the
  emoji/[window] prefix when present); several tickets get a collapsed
  `<blockquote expandable>` reference block (`code: title`) at the end.
- Codes Linear doesn't know stay plain text. A missing `linear` CLI or missing
  auth produces a one-time stderr hint; the message is always sent unchanged
  on any autolink failure.
- Toggle with `--no-feature autolink-tasks` or
  `features.autolink-tasks: false` in `~/.config/tg-cli/config.yaml`.

## 1.0.0

CLI ergonomics pass:

- `-v` / `--version`: print version, the running git commit hash, and this
  changelog, then exit 0.
- Help anywhere: `-h`/`--help` (or no arguments at all) prints usage to stdout
  and exits 0 instead of sending an empty message.
- Auto-attach paths: existing file paths found in the message text are attached
  automatically (images as photos, everything else as documents) and excised
  from the caption.
- `OK` on success: a successful send prints `OK` to stdout.
- Unknown dashed flags are an error: a stray `--foo` prints help to stderr and
  exits non-zero instead of being sent as message text. All real flags
  (`--format`, `--photo`, `--file`, `--ls-emoji-helpers`, `--detect-model`) are
  still recognized — the unknown-flag check runs only after they are matched.
